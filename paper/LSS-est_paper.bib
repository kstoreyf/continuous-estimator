abstract = {The baryon acoustic oscillations are a promising route to the precision measure of the cosmological distance scale and hence the measurement of the time evolution of dark energy. We show that the non-linear degradation of the acoustic signature in the correlations of low-redshift galaxies is a correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field, one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently, restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where the non-linearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At z=0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the acoustic scale by at least a factor of 2 and in principle by nearly a factor of 4. We discuss the significant implications our results have for the design of galaxy surveys aimed at measuring the distance scale through the acoustic peak.},

abstract = {We present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from the detections of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of galaxies from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our results come from the Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and covering approximately 8500 square degrees and the redshift range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.7. We also compare these results with those from the publicly released DR9 and DR10 samples. Assuming a concordance $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model, the DR11 sample covers a volume of 13 Gpc3 and is the largest region of the Universe ever surveyed at this density. We measure the correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the BAO feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of over 7$\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, rd, which has a value of rd,fid = 149.28 Mpc in our fiducial cosmology. We find DV = (1264 ± 25 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.32 and DV = (2056 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.57. At 1.0 per cent, this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. Separating the clustering along and transverse to the line of sight yields measurements at z = 0.57 of DA = (1421 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) and H = (96.8 ± 3.4 kms-1 Mpc-1)(rd,fid/rd). Our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement with previous BAO measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwave background data for a spatially flat CDM model with a cosmological constant. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {We present improved methodology for including covariance matrices in the error budget of Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) galaxy clustering measurements, revisiting Data Release 9 (DR9) analyses, and describing a method that is used in DR10/11 analyses presented in companion papers. The precise analysis method adopted is becoming increasingly important, due to the precision that BOSS can now reach: even using as many as 600 mock catalogues to estimate covariance of two-point clustering measurements can still lead to an increase in the errors of ̃20 per cent, depending on how the cosmological parameters of interest are measured. In this paper, we extend previous work on this contribution to the error budget, deriving formulae for errors measured by integrating over the likelihood, and to the distribution of recovered best-fitting parameters fitting the simulations also used to estimate the covariance matrix. Both are situations that previous analyses of BOSS have considered. We apply the formulae derived to baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements from BOSS in our companion papers. To further aid these analyses, we consider the optimum number of bins to use for two-point measurements using the monopole power spectrum or correlation function for BAO, and the monopole and quadrupole moments of the correlation function for anisotropic-BAO and RSD measurements. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

The mass could be in dark halos extending to this scale. Alternatively the mass could be clustered like the galaxies if matter loosely associated with the fainter galaxies deleted in our analysis carries the bulk of the mass density, so that M/L is a decreasing function of luminosity. We argue that the available evidence tends to favor the latter picture. We derive the cosmological density parameter Q = 0.2 e ± 04 for the component},

abstract = {We developed a modification to the calculation of the two-point correlation function commonly used in the analysis of large scale structure in cosmology. An estimator of the two-point correlation function is constructed by contrasting the observed distribution of galaxies with that of a uniformly populated random catalog. Using the assumption that the distribution of random galaxies in redshift is independent of angular position allows us to replace pairwise combinatorics with fast integration over probability maps. The new method significantly reduces the computation time while simultaneously increasing the precision of the calculation. It also allows to introduce cosmological parameters only at the last and least computationally expensive stage, which is helpful when exploring various choices for these parameters.},

abstract = {We provide a fast algorithm to diagnose any directional dependence in the cosmological parameters by calculating maps of local cosmological parameter estimates and their joint errors. The technique implements a fast quadratic estimator technique based on Wiener filtering and convolution of the sky with a patch shape. It uses only three map-resolution spherical harmonic transforms per parameter and applies to any data set with full sky or a partial sky coverage. We apply this method to Planck SMICA-2015 and obtain fluctuation map for six cosmological parameters. Our estimate shows that the Planck data is consistent with a single global value of the cosmological parameters and is not influenced by any severe local contaminations. This method is applicable also to other angular or 3D data sets of future missions to scrutinize any local variation in the cosmological parameters.},

abstract = {We investigate the bias and error in estimates of the cosmological parameter covariance matrix due to sampling or modelling the data covariance matrix, for likelihood width and peak scatter estimators.We show that these estimators do not coincide unless the data covariance is exactly known. For sampled data covariances with Gaussian-distributed data and parameters, the parameter covariance matrix estimated from the width of the likelihood has aWishart distribution, from which we derive the mean and covariance. This mean is biased and we propose an unbiased estimator of the parameter covariance matrix. Comparing our analytic results to a numerical Wishart sampler of the data covariance matrix we find excellent agreement. An accurate ansatz for the mean parameter covariance for the peak scatter estimator is found, and we fit its covariance to our numerical analysis. The mean is again biased and we propose an unbiased estimator for the peak parameter covariance. For sampled data covariances, the width estimator is more accurate than the peak scatter estimator. We investigate modelling the data covariance, or equivalently data compression, and show that the peak scatter estimator is less sensitive to biases in the model data covariance matrix than the width estimator, but requires independent realizations of the data to reduce the statistical error. If the model bias on the peak estimator is sufficiently low, this is promising, otherwise the sampled width estimator is preferable {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {We perform the first fit to the anisotropic clustering of SDSS-III CMASS DR10 galaxies on scales of ∼ 0.8−32 h −1 Mpc. A standard halo occupation distribution model evaluated near the best fit Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology provides a good fit to the observed anisotropic clustering, and implies a normalization for the peculiar velocity field of M ∼ 2 × 10 13 h −1 M halos of f $\sigma$ 8 (z = 0.57) = 0.450 ± 0.011. Since this constraint includes both quasi-linear and non-linear scales, it should severely constrain modified gravity models that enhance pairwise infall velocities on these scales. Though model dependent, our measurement represents a factor of 2.5 improvement in precision over the analysis of DR11 on large scales, f $\sigma$ 8 (z = 0.57) = 0.447 ± 0.028, and is the tightest single constraint on the growth rate of cosmic structure to date. Our measurement is consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM prediction of 0.480 ± 0.010 at the ∼ 1.9$\sigma$ level. Assuming a halo mass function evaluated at the best fit Planck cosmology, we also find that 10{\%} of CMASS galaxies are satellites in halos of mass M ∼ 6 × 10 13 h −1 M. While none of our tests and model generalizations indicate systematic errors due to an insufficiently detailed model of the galaxy-halo connection, the precision of these first results warrant further investigation into the modeling uncertainties and degeneracies with cosmological parameters.},

abstract = {The two-point correlation function (2PCF) is the most widely used tool for quantifying the spatial distribution of galaxies. Since the distribution of galaxies is determined by galaxy formation physics as well as the underlying cosmology, fitting an observed correlation function yields valuable insights into both. The calculation for a 2PCF involves computing pair-wise separations and consequently, the computing time scales quadratically with the number of galaxies. The next-generation galaxy surveys are slated to observe many millions of galaxies, and computing the 2PCF for such surveys would be prohibitively time-consuming. Additionally, modern modelling techniques require the 2PCF to be calculated thousands of times on simulated galaxy catalogues of {\{}$\backslash$em at least{\}} equal size to the data and would be completely unfeasible for the next generation surveys. Thus, calculating the 2PCF forms a substantial bottleneck in improving our understanding of the fundamental physics of the universe, and we need high-performance software to compute the correlation function. In this paper, we present Corrfunc --- a suite of highly optimised, OpenMP parallel clustering codes. The improved performance of Corrfunc arises from both efficient algorithms as well as software design that suits the underlying hardware of modern CPUs. Corrfunc can compute a wide range of 2-D and 3-D correlation functions in either simulation (Cartesian) space or on-sky coordinates. Corrfunc runs efficiently in both single- and multi-threaded modes and can compute a typical 2-point projected correlation function ({\$}w{\_}p(r{\_}p){\$}) for {\~{}}1 million galaxies within a few seconds on a single thread. Corrfunc is designed to be both user-friendly and fast and is publicly available at https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc.},

We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z=1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4{\%} fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5{\%} accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Omega{\_}mh{\^{}}2 to 8{\%} and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Omega{\_}m = 0.273 +- 0.025 + 0.123 (1+w{\_}0) + 0.137 Omega{\_}K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is Omega{\_}K=-0.010+-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

abstract = {We present cosmological results from the final galaxy clustering data set of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our combined galaxy sample comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies over an effective area of 9329 deg 2 and volume of 18.7 Gpc 3 , divided into three partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective redshifts 0.38, 0.51, and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance D M and Hubble parameter H from the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method after applying reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature. Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the product D M H from the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by f $\sigma$ 8 (z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We combine individual measurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than those from any one method; in particular, the AP measurement from sub-BAO scales sharpens constraints from post-reconstruction BAO by breaking degeneracy between D M and H. Combined with Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply curvature $\Omega$ K = 0.0003 ± 0.0026 and a dark energy equation of state parameter w = −1.01 ± 0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM). Our RSD measurements of f $\sigma$ 8 , at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent with this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H 0 = 67.3 ± 1.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some direct measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom loosens the constraint only slightly, to H 0 = 67.8 ± 1.2 km s −1 Mpc −1. Assuming flat $\Lambda$CDM we find $\Omega$ m = 0.310 ± 0.005 and H 0 = 67.6 ± 0.5 km s −1 Mpc −1 , and we find a 95{\%} upper limit of 0.16 eV/c 2 on the neutrino mass sum.},

abstract = {We present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derived from a sample of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Seventh Data Release (DR7). The halo power spectrum has a direct connection to the underlying dark matter power for k ≤ 0.2 h Mpc-1, well into the quasi-linear regime. This enables us to use a factor of {\~{}}8 more modes in the cosmological analysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h Mpc-1,aswas adopted in the SDSS team analysis of the DR4 LRG sample. The observed halo power spectrum for 0.02 {\textless}k{\textless}0.2 h Mpc-1 is well fitted by our model: $\chi$2 = 39.6 for 40 degrees of freedom for the best-fitting $\Delta$ cold dark matter ($\Delta$CDM) model. We find $\Omega$mh2(ns/0.96)1.2 = 0.141+0.010-0.012 for a power-law primordial power spectrum with spectral index ns and $\Omega$bh2 = 0.022 65 fixed, consistent with cosmic microwave background measurements. The halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance to z = 0.35: rs/DV(0.35) = 0.1097+0.0039-0.0042. Combining the halo power spectrum measurement with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5 year results, for the flat $\Delta$CDM model we find $\Omega$m = 0.289 ± 0.019 and H0 = 69.4 ± 1.6 km s-1 Mpc-1. Allowing ∑ for massive neutrinos in $\Delta$CDM, we find $\sigma$m$\nu$ {\textless} 0.62 eV at the 95 per cent confidence level. If we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species Neff as a free parameter, we find Neff = 4.8+1.8-1.7. Combining also with the Kowalski et al. supernova sample, we find $\Omega$tot = 1.011 ± 0.009 and w =-0.99 ± 0.11 for an open cosmology with constant dark energy equation of state w.

abstract = {Context. The coeval active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxy evolution, and the observed local relations between super massive black holes (SMBHs) and galaxy properties suggest some sort of connection or feedback between SMBH growth (i.e., AGN activity) and galaxy build-up (i.e., star formation history). Aims. We looked for correlations between average properties of X-ray detected AGN and their far-IR (FIR) detected, star forming host galaxies in order to find quantitative evidence for this connection, which has been highly debated in recent years. Methods. We exploited the rich multiwavelength data set (from X-ray to FIR) available in the COSMOS field for a large sample (692 sources) of AGN and their hosts in the redshift range 0.1 {\textless}z{\textless} 4. We use X-ray data to select AGN and determine their properties, such as X-ray intrinsic luminosity and nuclear obscuration, and broadband (from UV to FIR) SED fitting results to derive host galaxy properties, such as stellar mass (M∗) and star formation rate (SFR). Results. We find that the AGN 2-10 keV luminosity (LX) and the host 8-1000 $\mu$m star formation luminosity (LIRSF) are significantly correlated, even after removing the dependency of both quantities with redshift. However, the average host LIRSF has a flat distribution in bins of AGN LX, while the average AGN LX increases in bins of host LIRSF with logarithmic slope of {\~{}}0.7 in the redshift range 0.4 {\textless}z{\textless} 1.2. We also discuss the comparison between the full distribution of these two quantities and the predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. No other significant correlations between AGN LX and host properties is found. On the other hand, we find that the average column density (NH) shows a clear positive correlation with the host M∗ at all redshifts, but not with the SFR (or LIRSF). This translates into a negative correlation with specific SFR at all redshifts. The same is true if the obscured fraction is computed. Conclusions. Our results are in agreement with the idea, introduced in recent galaxy evolutionary models, that SMBH accretion and SFRs are correlated, but occur with different variability time scales. Finally, the presence of a positive correlation between NH and host M∗ suggests that the column density that we observe in the X-rays is not entirely due to the circumnuclear obscuring torus, but may also include a significant contribution from the host galaxy.},

abstract = {We examine the correlation function $\xi$ of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Luminous Red Galaxy sample at large scales (60 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 400 h -1 Mpc) using the final data release (DR7). Focusing on a quasi-volume-limited (0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.36) subsample and utilizing mock galaxy catalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and larger scale signal are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM at 70{\%}-95{\%} confidence. Fitting data to a non-linear, redshift-space, template-based model, we constrain the peak position at s p = 101.7± 3.0 h -1 Mpc when fitting the range 60 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 150 h -1 Mpc (1$\sigma$ uncertainties). This redshift-space distance s p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale rs after taking into account matter-clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions, and galaxy-clustering bias. Mock catalogs show that the probability that a DR7-sized sample would not have an identifiable peak is at least {\~{}}10{\%}. As a consistency check of a fiducial cosmology, we use the observed s p to obtain the distance D{\_}V≡ ((1+z){\^{}}2D{\_}A{\^{}}2cz/H(z)){\^{}}{\{}{\{}1{\}}/{\{}3{\}}{\}} relative to the acoustic scale. We find rs /DV (z = 0.278) = 0.1389 ± 0.0043. This result is in excellent agreement with Percival et al., who examine roughly the same data set, but use the power spectrum. Comparison with other determinations in the literature are also in very good agreement. The signal of the full sample at 125 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 200 h -1 Mpc tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; this slight deviation can probably be attributed to sample variance. We have tested our results against a battery of possible systematic effects, finding all effects are smaller than our estimated sample variance.},

abstract = {We provide scaling relations and fitting formulae for adiabatic cold dark matter cosmologies that account for all baryon effects in the matter transfer function to better than 10{\%} in the large-scale structure regime. They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot, baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold-dark-matter growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction Ω b /Ω 0 ∼ {\textgreater} Ω 0 h 2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter $\Gamma$.

abstract = {The covariance matrices of Power-Spectrum (P(k)) measurements from galaxy surveys are difficult to compute theoretically. The current best practice is to estimate covariance matrices by computing a sample covariance of a large number of mock catalogues. The next generation of galaxy surveys will require thousands of large volume mocks to determine the covariance matrices to desired accuracy. The errors in the inverse covariance matrix are larger and scale with the number of P(k) bins, making the problem even more acute. We develop a method of estimating covariance matrices using a theoretically justified, Few-Parameter model, calibrated with mock catalogues. Using a set of 600 BOSS DR11 mock catalogues, we show that a seven parameter model is sufficient to fit the covariance matrix of BOSS DR11 P(k) measurements. The covariance computed with this method is better than the sample covariance at any number of mocks and only ∼100 mocks are required for it to fully converge and the inverse covariance matrix converges at the same rate. This method shouldwork equally well for the next generation of galaxy surveys, although a demand for higher accuracy may require adding extra parameters to the fitting function.},

We fit the clustering results with a $\Lambda$cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model to calculate the linear bias of the quasar sample, b = 3.74 ± 0.12. The measured value of bias is consistent with the findings of White et al., where they analyse almost the same quasar sample, although only in the range s {\textless} 40 h-1 Mpc. At large scales we observe an excess or plateau in the clustering correlation function. By fitting a model that incorporates a scale dependent additional term in the bias introduced by primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type, we calculate the amplitude of the deviation from the Gaussian initial conditions as 70 {\textless} fNLlocal {\textless} 190 at the 95 per cent confidence level. We correct the sample from systematics according to the methods of Ross et al. and Ho et al., with the fNLlocal measurements after the application of the two methods being consistent with each other. Finally, we use cross-correlations across redshift slices to test the corrected sample for any remaining unknown sources of systematics, but the results give no indication of any such further errors. We consider as our final results on non-Gaussianity, 46 {\textless} fNLlocal {\textless} 158 at 95 per cent confidence, after correcting the sample with the weights method of Ross et al.

abstract = {Measuring the two-point correlation function of the galaxies in the Universe gives access to the underlying dark matter distribution, which is related to cosmological parameters and to the physics of the primordial Universe. The estimation of the correlation function for current galaxy surveys makes use of the Landy-Szalay estimator, which is supposed to reach minimal variance. This is only true, however, for a vanishing correlation function. We study the Landy-Szalay estimator when these conditions are not fulfilled and propose a new estimator that provides the smallest variance for a given survey geometry. Our estimator is a linear combination of ratios between paircounts of data and/or random catalogues (DD, RR and DR). The optimal combination for a given geometry is determined by using lognormal mock catalogues. The resulting estimator is biased in a model-dependent way, but we propose a simple iterative procedure for obtaining an unbiased model-independent estimator. Our method can be easily applied to any dataset and requires few extra mock catalogues compared to the standard Landy-Szalay analysis. Using various sets of simulated data (lognormal, second-order LPT and N-Body), we obtain a 20-25{\%} gain on the error bars on the two-point correlation function for the SDSS geometry and $\Lambda$CDM correlation function. When applied to SDSS data (DR7 and DR9), we achieve a similar gain on the correlation functions, which translates into a 10-15{\%} improvement over the estimation of the densities of matter Ωm and dark energy Ω$\Lambda$ in an open $\Lambda$CDM model. The constraints derived from DR7 data with our estimator are similar to those obtained with the DR9 data and the Landy-Szalay estimator, which covers a volume twice as large and has a density that is three times higher.},

abstract = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large-scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i = 19.9 over 10,000deg2 to measure BAO to redshifts z {\textless} 0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Ly$\alpha$ forest in more than 150,000quasar spectra (g {\textless} 22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance dA to an accuracy of 1.0{\%} at redshifts z = 0.3 and z = 0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8{\%} and 1.7{\%} at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Ly$\alpha$ forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate DA (z) and H -1(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9{\%} at z ∼ 2.5 when the survey is complete.

abstract = {We measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in the largest-ever galaxy redshift survey, the main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Seventh Data Release. We focus on the projected correlation function wp (rp ) of volume-limited samples, extracted from the parent sample of 700,000 galaxies over 8000 deg2, extending up to redshift of 0.25. We interpret our measurements using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling assuming a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant). The amplitude of wp (rp ) grows slowly with luminosity for L {\textless} L* and increases sharply at higher luminosities, with a large-scale bias factor b({\textgreater} L) × ($\sigma$8/0.8) = 1.06 + 0.21(L/L*) 1.12, where L is the sample luminosity threshold. At fixed luminosity, redder galaxies exhibit a higher amplitude and steeper correlation function, a steady trend that runs through the "blue cloud" and "green valley" and continues across the "red sequence." The cross-correlation of red and blue galaxies is close to the geometric mean of their autocorrelations, dropping slightly below at rp {\textless} 1 h -1 Mpc. The luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations separately are strikingly different. Blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of clustering strength with luminosity, with nearly constant shape of wp (rp ). The large-scale clustering of red galaxies shows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at L {\textgreater} 4 L *, but the lowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 L *) show very strong clustering on small scales (rp {\textless} 2 h -1 Mpc). Most of the observed trends can be naturally understood within the $\Lambda$CDM+HOD framework. The growth of wp (rp ) for higher luminosity galaxies reflects an overall shift in the mass scale of their host dark matter halos, in particular an increase in the minimum host halo mass Mmin. The mass at which a halo has, on average, one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M1 ≈ 17 M min(L) over most of the luminosity range, with a smaller ratio above L*. The growth and steepening of wp (rp ) for redder galaxies reflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in high-mass halos instead of central systems in low-mass halos, a trend that is especially marked at low luminosities. Our extensive measurements, provided in tabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxy formation, a firm grounding of semiempirical models of the galaxy population, and new constraints on cosmological parameters from combining real-space galaxy clustering with mass-sensitive statistics such as redshift-space distortions, cluster mass-to-light ratios, and galaxy-galaxy lensing. {\textcopyright} 2011.

abstract = {Intrinsically bright galaxies appear systematically more correlated than faint galaxies in the Center for Astrophysics redshift survey. The amplification of the 2-point correlation function behaves exponentially with luminosity, being essentially flat up to the knee of the luminosity function, then increasing markedly. The amplification reaches a factor of 3.5e ±0 * 4 in the very brightest galaxies. The effect is dominated by spirals rather than ellipticals, so that the correlation function of bright spirals becomes comparable to that of normal ellipticals. Similar results are obtained whether the correlation function is measured in two or three dimensions. The effect persists to separations of a correlation length or more, and is not confined to the cores of the Virgo, Coma, and Abell 1367 clusters, suggesting that the effect is caused by biasing, that is, galaxies kindle preferentially in more clustered regions, rather than by gravitational relaxation.},

abstract = {Aims. The maximum-likelihood method is the standard approach to obtain model fits to observational data and the corresponding confidence regions. We investigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood function and its subsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the inverse covariance matrix. Furthermore, we study under which circumstances the estimated covariance matrix is invertible. Methods. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the behaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on the number of independent data sets and the number of variables of the data vectors. Results. We find that the inverse of the maximum-likelihood estimator of the covariance is biased, the amount of bias depending on the ratio of the number of bins (data vector variables), p, to the number of data sets, n. This bias inevitably leads to an - in extreme cases catastrophic - underestimation of the size of confidence regions. We report on a method to remove this bias for the idealised case of Gaussian noise and statistically independent data vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that marginalisation over parameters introduces a bias into the marginalised log-likelihood function. Measures of the sizes of confidence regions suffer from the same problem. Furthermore, we give an analytic proof for the fact that the estimated covariance matrix is singular if p {\textgreater} n. {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

abstract = {Observations reveal a "bulk flow" in the local Universe which is faster and extends to much larger scales than are expected around a typical observer in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This is expected to result in a scale-dependent dipolar modulation of the acceleration of the expansion rate inferred from observations of objects within the bulk flow. From a maximum-likelihood analysis of the Joint Light-curve Analysis catalogue of Type Ia supernovae, we find that the deceleration parameter, in addition to a small monopole, indeed has a much bigger dipole component aligned with the cosmic microwave background dipole, which falls exponentially with redshift z: q0 = qm + qd.n' exp(-z/S). The best fit to data yields qd = -8.03 and S = 0.0262 (? d ∼ 100 Mpc), rejecting isotropy (qd = 0) with 3.9$\sigma$ statistical significance, while qm = -0.157 and consistent with no acceleration (qm = 0) at 1.4$\sigma$. Thus the cosmic acceleration deduced from supernovae may be an artefact of our being non-Copernican observers, rather than evidence for a dominant component of "dark energy" in the Universe.},

abstract = {The Fisher matrix is a widely used tool to forecast the performance of future experiments and approximate the likelihood of large data sets. Most of the forecasts for cosmological parameters in galaxy clustering studies rely on the Fisher matrix approach for large-scale experiments like DES, Euclid, or SKA. Here we improve upon the standard method by taking into account three effects: the finite window function, the correlation between redshift bins, and the uncertainty on the bin redshift. The first two effects are negligible only in the limit of infinite surveys. The third effect, on the contrary, is negligible for infinitely small bins. Here we show how to take into account these effects and what the impact on forecasts of a Euclid-type experiment will be. The main result of this article is that the windowing and the bin cross-correlation induce a considerable change in the forecasted errors, of the order of 10-30{\%} for most cosmological parameters, while the redshift bin uncertainty can be neglected for bins smaller than ∆z = 0.1 roughly.},

abstract = {Second-order measures, such as the two-point correlation function, are geometrical quantities describing the clustering properties of a point distribution. In this article well-known estimators for the correlation integral are reviewed and their relation to geometrical estimators for the two-point correlation function is put forward. Simulations illustrate the range of applicability of these estimators. The interpretation of the two-point correlation function as the excess of clustering with respect to Poisson distributed points has led to biases in common estimators. Comparing with the approximately unbiased geometrical estimators, we show how biases enter the estimators introduced by Davis and Peebles, Landy and Szalay, and Hamilton. We give recommendations for the application of the estimators, including details of the numerical implementation. The properties of the estimators of the correlation integral are illustrated in an application to a sample of IRAS galaxies. It is found that, due to the limitations of current galaxy catalogues in number and depth, no reliable determination of the correlation integral on large scales is possible. In the sample of IRAS galaxies considered, several estimators using different finite-size corrections yield different results on scales larger than 20 Mpc/h, while all of them agree on smaller scales.},

abstract = {Nine of the most important estimators known for the two-point correlation function are compared using a predetermined, rigorous criterion. The indicators were extracted from over 500 subsamples of the Virgo Hubble Volume simulation cluster catalog. The ``real'' correlation function was determined from the full survey in a 3000Mpc/h periodic cube. The estimators were ranked by the cumulative probability of returning a value within a certain tolerance of the real correlation function. This criterion takes into account bias and variance, and it is independent of the possibly non-Gaussian nature of the error statistics. As a result for astrophysical applications a clear recommendation has emerged: the Landy {\&} Szalay (1993) estimator, in its original or grid version Szapudi {\&} Szalay (1998), are preferred in comparison to the other indicators examined, with a performance almost indistinguishable from the Hamilton (1993) estimator.},

The BOSS-DR12 dataset includes 1,198,006 massive galaxies spread over the redshift range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.75. These galaxy samples are categorized in three redshift bins. Using CLPT-GSRSD in our analysis of the combined sample of the three redshift bins, we report measurements of f $\sigma$ 8 for the three redshift bins. We find f $\sigma$ 8 = 0.430 ± 0.054 at z eff = 0.38, f $\sigma$ 8 = 0.452 ± 0.057 at z eff = 0.51 and f $\sigma$ 8 = 0.457 ± 0.052 at z eff = 0.61. Our results are consistent with the predictions of Planck $\Lambda$CDM-GR. Our constraints on the growth rates of structure in the Universe at different redshifts serve as a useful probe, which can help distinguish between a model of the Universe based on dark energy and models based on modified theories of gravity. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from BOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others in Alam et al.

Using Python bindings of the Message Passing Interface (MPI), we provide parallel implementations of many commonly used algorithms in LSS. nbodykit is both an interactive and scalable piece of scientific software, performing well in a supercomputing environment while still taking advantage of the interactive tools provided by the Python ecosystem. Existing functionality includes estimators of the power spectrum, 2 and 3-point correlation functions, a Friends-of-Friends grouping algorithm, mock catalog creation via the halo occupation distribution technique, and approximate N-body simulations via the FastPM scheme. The package also provides a set of distributed data containers, insulated from the algorithms themselves, that enable nbodykit to provide a unified treatment of both simulation and observational data sets. nbodykit can be easily deployed in a high performance computing environment, overcoming some of the traditional difficulties of using Python on supercomputers. We provide performance benchmarks illustrating the scalability of the software. The modular, component-based approach of nbodykit allows researchers to easily build complex applications using its tools. The package is extensively documented at http://nbodykit.readthedocs.io, which also includes an interactive set of example recipes for new users to explore. As open-source software, we hope nbodykit provides a common framework for the community to use and develop in confronting the analysis challenges of future LSS surveys.},

Put another way, the ML estimator can reach the same precision as the LS estimator with a significantly smaller random point catalog. Moreover, these gains are achieved without significantly increasing the computational requirements for estimating {\{}$\backslash$xi{\}}.

Assuming a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc 3 , and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, ¯ n ≈ 3 × 10 −4 h −3 Mpc 3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5$\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II Luminous Red Galaxy Sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7$\sigma$. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z = 0.57 relative to the sound horizon D V /r s = 13.67 ± 0.22 at z = 0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance D V (z = 0.57) = 2094 ± 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

We combine this information with additional data from recent cosmic microwave background (CMB), supernova and baryon acoustic oscillation measurements. Our results show no significant evidence of deviations from the standard flat $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model, whose basic parameters can be specified by $\Omega$m = 0.285 ± 0.009, 100$\Omega$b = 4.59 ± 0.09, ns = 0.961 ± 0.009, H0 = 69.4 ± 0.8kms-1Mpc-1 and $\sigma$8 = 0.80 ± 0.02. The CMB+CMASS combination sets tight constraints on the curvature of the Universe, with $\Omega$k = -0.0043 ± 0.0049, and the tensor-to-scalar amplitude ratio, for which we find r {\textless} 0.16 at the 95per cent confidence level (CL). These data show a clear signature of a deviation from scale invariance also in the presence of tensor modes, with ns {\textless} 1 at the 99.7per cent CL. We derive constraints on the fraction of massive neutrinos of f$\nu$ {\textless} 0.049 (95per cent CL), implying a limit of ∑m$\nu$ {\textless} 0.51eV. We find no signature of a deviation from a cosmological constant from the combination of all data sets, with a constraint of wDE = -1.033 ± 0.073 when this parameter is assumed time-independent, and no evidence of a departure from this value when it is allowed to evolve as wDE(a) = w0 + wa(1 - a). The achieved accuracy on our cosmological constraints is a clear demonstration of the constraining power of current cosmological observations. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

abstract = {Cosmological parameter estimation requires that the likelihood function of the data is accurately known. Assuming that cosmological large-scale structure power spectra data are multivariate Gaussian distributed, we show that the accuracy of parameter estimation is limited by the accuracy of the inverse data covariance matrix - the precision matrix. If the data covariance and precision matrices are estimated by sampling independent realizations of the data, their statistical properties are described by theWishart and inverse-Wishart distributions, respectively. Independent of any details of the survey, we show that the fractional error on a parameter variance, or a figure of merit, is equal to the fractional variance of the precision matrix. In addition, for the only unbiased estimator of the precision matrix, we find that the fractional accuracy of the parameter error depends only on the difference between the number of independent realizations and the number of data points, and so can easily diverge. For a 5 per cent error on a parameter error and ND « 102 data points, a minimum of 200 realizations of the survey are needed, with 10 per cent accuracy in the data covariance. If the number of data points ND » 102, we need NS {\textgreater} ND realizations and a fractional accuracy of {\textless} √2/ND in the data covariance. As the number of power spectra data points grows to ND {\textgreater} 104-106, this approach will be problematic. We discuss possible ways to relax these conditions: improved theoretical modelling, shrinkage methods, data compression, simulation and data resampling methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {Tracing the cosmic evolution of the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale with galaxy two-point correlation functions is currently the most promising approach to detect dark energy at early times. A number of ongoing and future experiments will measure the BAO peak with unprecedented accuracy. We show based on a set of N-body simulations that the matter distribution is anisotropic out to 150 h -1 Mpc, far beyond the BAO scale of 100 h -1 Mpc, and discuss implications for the measurement of the BAO. To that purpose we use alignment correlation functions, i.e., cross-correlation functions between high density peaks and the overall matter distribution measured along the orientation of the peaks and perpendicular to it. The correlation function measured along (perpendicular to) the orientation of high density peaks is enhanced (reduced) by a factor of two compared to the conventional correlation function and the location of the BAO peak shifts toward smaller (larger) scales if measured along (perpendicular to) the orientation of the high density peaks. Similar effects are expected to shape observed galaxy correlation functions at BAO scales. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

abstract = {The use of a lognormal (LN) random field, non-Gaussian random field as a model for the distribution of matter in the universe is discussed. As the general LN field includes the Gaussian case in the limit of zero rms fluctuation it is possible to perform a statistical decomposition. The statistical properties of the model can be formulated in terms of one covariance function. Difficulties with the statistical treatment of density perturbations such as the fact that the LN model is not completely specified by its moments have been revealed by analysis of the model. It is shown that for discriminating between Gaussian and non-Gaussian fluctuations the method of representing the three- and four-point correlation functions of galaxies in terms of the parameters Q and R is not useful. Parameterizations in terms of the skewness and kurtosis are proposed.},

abstract = {We apply the methodology developed in $\backslash$cite{\{}Li2014,Li2015{\}} to BOSS DR12 galaxies and derive cosmological constraints from the redshift dependence of the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect. The apparent anisotropy in the distribution of observed galaxies arise from two main sources, the redshift-space distortion (RSD) effect due to the galaxy peculiar velocities, and the geometric distortion when incorrect cosmological models are assumed for transforming redshift to comoving distance, known as the AP effect. Anisotropies produced by the RSD effect are, although large, maintaining a nearly uniform magnitude over a large range of redshift, while the degree of anisotropies from the AP effect varies with redshift by much larger magnitude. We split the DR12 galaxies into six redshift bins, measure the 2-point correlation function in each bin, and assess the redshift evolution of anisotropies. We obtain constraints of {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m=0.290 \backslashpm 0.053,\backslash \backslash w = -1.07 \backslashpm 0.15{\$}, which are comparable with the current constraints from other cosmological probes such as type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background, and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO). Combining these cosmological probes with our method yield tight constraints of {\$} \backslashOmega{\_}m = 0.301 \backslashpm 0.006,\backslash w=-1.054 \backslashpm 0.025{\$}. Our method is complementary to the other large scale structure probes like BAO and topology. We expect this technique will play an important role in deriving cosmological constraints from large scale structure surveys.},

This test is unusual in that it involves no correction for evolutionary effects. We present here the idealised conception of the method, and hint at the statistical problem that its realisation entails. Consider a collection of test objects emitting radiation containing spectral lines (so that redshifts may be determined), which are distributed on the surface of a sphere. (Any spherically symmetric, bounded distribution will do; this idealisation is for convenience only.) Let the sphere expand with the local Hubble flow. When observed at a great distance the redshifts of these objects will be confined to some narrow interval (z-6.z, z + 6.z), and their distribution on the sky will be confined in some circle of angular radius tJ.().

@article{Grimmett2020,
abstract = {Studies investigating the relationship between star formation rate (SFR) and AGN power often rely on averaging techniques -- such as stacking -- to incorporate information from non-detections. However, averages, and especially means, can be strongly affected by outliers and can therefore give a misleading indication of the "typical" case. Recently, a number of studies have taken a step further by binning their sample in terms of AGN power, and investigating how the SFR distribution differs between these bins. These bin thresholds are often weakly motivated, and binning implicitly assumes that sources within the same bin have similar (or even identical) properties. In this paper, we investigate whether the main sequence-normalised SFR (i.e., starburstiness, {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm MS{\}}{\$}) distribution changes continuously as a function of AGN power, using a hierarchical Bayesian model that completely removes the need to bin. In doing so, we find strong evidence that the {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm MS{\}}{\$} distribution changes with AGN power, such that higher X-ray luminosity AGNs have a tighter physical connection to the star forming process than lower luminosity AGNs.},
