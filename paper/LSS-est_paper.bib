abstract = {We present cosmological results from the final galaxy clustering data set of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our combined galaxy sample comprises 1.2 million massive galaxies over an effective area of 9329 deg 2 and volume of 18.7 Gpc 3 , divided into three partially overlapping redshift slices centred at effective redshifts 0.38, 0.51, and 0.61. We measure the angular diameter distance D M and Hubble parameter H from the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) method after applying reconstruction to reduce non-linear effects on the BAO feature. Using the anisotropic clustering of the pre-reconstruction density field, we measure the product D M H from the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the growth of structure, quantified by f $\sigma$ 8 (z), from redshift-space distortions (RSD). We combine individual measurements presented in seven companion papers into a set of consensus values and likelihoods, obtaining constraints that are tighter and more robust than those from any one method; in particular, the AP measurement from sub-BAO scales sharpens constraints from post-reconstruction BAO by breaking degeneracy between D M and H. Combined with Planck 2015 cosmic microwave background measurements, our distance scale measurements simultaneously imply curvature $\Omega$ K = 0.0003 ± 0.0026 and a dark energy equation of state parameter w = −1.01 ± 0.06, in strong affirmation of the spatially flat cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$CDM). Our RSD measurements of f $\sigma$ 8 , at 6 per cent precision, are similarly consistent with this model. When combined with supernova Ia data, we find H 0 = 67.3 ± 1.0 km s −1 Mpc −1 even for our most general dark energy model, in tension with some direct measurements. Adding extra relativistic species as a degree of freedom loosens the constraint only slightly, to H 0 = 67.8 ± 1.2 km s −1 Mpc −1. Assuming flat $\Lambda$CDM we find $\Omega$ m = 0.310 ± 0.005 and H 0 = 67.6 ± 0.5 km s −1 Mpc −1 , and we find a 95{\%} upper limit of 0.16 eV/c 2 on the neutrino mass sum.},

abstract = {How does the clustering of galaxies depend on their inner properties like morphological type and luminosity? We address this question in the mathematical framework of marked point processes and clarify the notion of luminosity and morphological segregation. A number of test quantities such as conditional mark-weighted two-point correlation functions are introduced. These descriptors allow for a scale-dependent analysis of luminosity and morphology segregation. Moreover, they break the degeneracy between an inhomogeneous fractal point set and actual present luminosity segregation. Using the Southern Sky Redshift Survey{\~{}}2 (da Costa et al. 1998, SSRS2) we find both luminosity and morphological segregation at a high level of significance, confirming claims by previous works using these data (Benoist et al. 1996, Willmer et al. 1998). Specifically, the average luminosity and the fluctuations in the luminosity of pairs of galaxies are enhanced out to separations of 15Mpc/h. On scales smaller than 3Mpc/h the luminosities on galaxy pairs show a tight correlation. A comparison with the random-field model indicates that galaxy luminosities depend on the spatial distribution and galaxy-galaxy interactions. Early-type galaxies are also more strongly correlated, indicating morphological segregation. The galaxies in the PSCz catalog (Saunders et al. 2000) do not show significant luminosity segregation. This again illustrates that mainly early-type galaxies contribute to luminosity segregation. However, based on several independent investigations we show that the observed luminosity segregation can not be explained by the morphology-density relation alone.},

abstract = {Aims. The maximum-likelihood method is the standard approach to obtain model fits to observational data and the corresponding confidence regions. We investigate possible sources of bias in the log-likelihood function and its subsequent analysis, focusing on estimators of the inverse covariance matrix. Furthermore, we study under which circumstances the estimated covariance matrix is invertible. Methods. We perform Monte-Carlo simulations to investigate the behaviour of estimators for the inverse covariance matrix, depending on the number of independent data sets and the number of variables of the data vectors. Results. We find that the inverse of the maximum-likelihood estimator of the covariance is biased, the amount of bias depending on the ratio of the number of bins (data vector variables), p, to the number of data sets, n. This bias inevitably leads to an - in extreme cases catastrophic - underestimation of the size of confidence regions. We report on a method to remove this bias for the idealised case of Gaussian noise and statistically independent data vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that marginalisation over parameters introduces a bias into the marginalised log-likelihood function. Measures of the sizes of confidence regions suffer from the same problem. Furthermore, we give an analytic proof for the fact that the estimated covariance matrix is singular if p {\textgreater} n. {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

The survey data will allow us to measure the dark energy and dark matter densities and the dark energy equation of state through four independent methods: galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing tomography, galaxy angular clustering, and supernova distances. These methods are doubly complementary: they constrain different combinations of cosmological model parameters and are subject to different systematic errors. By deriving the four sets of measurements from the same data set with a common analysis framework, we will obtain important cross checks of the systematic errors and thereby make a substantial and robust advance in the precision of dark energy measurements.},

@article{Zehavi2011,
abstract = {We measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in the largest-ever galaxy redshift survey, the main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Seventh Data Release. We focus on the projected correlation function wp (rp ) of volume-limited samples, extracted from the parent sample of 700,000 galaxies over 8000 deg2, extending up to redshift of 0.25. We interpret our measurements using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling assuming a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology (inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant). The amplitude of wp (rp ) grows slowly with luminosity for L {\textless} L* and increases sharply at higher luminosities, with a large-scale bias factor b({\textgreater} L) × ($\sigma$8/0.8) = 1.06 + 0.21(L/L*) 1.12, where L is the sample luminosity threshold. At fixed luminosity, redder galaxies exhibit a higher amplitude and steeper correlation function, a steady trend that runs through the "blue cloud" and "green valley" and continues across the "red sequence." The cross-correlation of red and blue galaxies is close to the geometric mean of their autocorrelations, dropping slightly below at rp {\textless} 1 h -1 Mpc. The luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations separately are strikingly different. Blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of clustering strength with luminosity, with nearly constant shape of wp (rp ). The large-scale clustering of red galaxies shows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at L {\textgreater} 4 L *, but the lowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 L *) show very strong clustering on small scales (rp {\textless} 2 h -1 Mpc). Most of the observed trends can be naturally understood within the $\Lambda$CDM+HOD framework. The growth of wp (rp ) for higher luminosity galaxies reflects an overall shift in the mass scale of their host dark matter halos, in particular an increase in the minimum host halo mass Mmin. The mass at which a halo has, on average, one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M1 ≈ 17 M min(L) over most of the luminosity range, with a smaller ratio above L*. The growth and steepening of wp (rp ) for redder galaxies reflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in high-mass halos instead of central systems in low-mass halos, a trend that is especially marked at low luminosities. Our extensive measurements, provided in tabular form, will allow detailed tests of theoretical models of galaxy formation, a firm grounding of semiempirical models of the galaxy population, and new constraints on cosmological parameters from combining real-space galaxy clustering with mass-sensitive statistics such as redshift-space distortions, cluster mass-to-light ratios, and galaxy-galaxy lensing. {\textcopyright} 2011.

We show based on a set of N-body simulations that the matter distribution is anisotropic out to 150 h -1 Mpc, far beyond the BAO scale of 100 h -1 Mpc, and discuss implications for the measurement of the BAO. To that purpose we use alignment correlation functions, i.e., cross-correlation functions between high density peaks and the overall matter distribution measured along the orientation of the peaks and perpendicular to it. The correlation function measured along (perpendicular to) the orientation of high density peaks is enhanced (reduced) by a factor of two compared to the conventional correlation function and the location of the BAO peak shifts toward smaller (larger) scales if measured along (perpendicular to) the orientation of the high density peaks. Similar effects are expected to shape observed galaxy correlation functions at BAO scales. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

abstract = {We use analytic covariance matrices to carry out a full-shape analysis of the galaxy power spectrum multipoles from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We obtain parameter estimates that agree well with those based on the sample covariance from two thousand galaxy mock catalogs, thus validating the analytic approach and providing substantial reduction in computational cost. We also highlight a number of additional advantages of analytic covariances. First, the analysis does not suffer from sampling noise, which biases the constraints and typically requires inflating parameter error bars. Second, it allows us to study convergence of the cosmological constraints when recomputing the analytic covariances to match the best-fit power spectrum, which can be done at a negligible computational cost, unlike when using mock catalogs. These effects reduce the systematic error budget of cosmological constraints, which suggests that the analytic approach may be an important tool for upcoming high-precision galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid. Finally, we study the impact of various ingredients in the power spectrum covariance matrix and show that the non-Gaussian part, which includes the regular trispectrum and super-sample covariance, has a marginal effect ({\$}\backslashlesssim 10 \backslash{\%}{\$}) on the cosmological parameter error bars.

We fit the clustering results with a $\Lambda$cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model to calculate the linear bias of the quasar sample, b = 3.74 ± 0.12. The measured value of bias is consistent with the findings of White et al., where they analyse almost the same quasar sample, although only in the range s {\textless} 40 h-1 Mpc. At large scales we observe an excess or plateau in the clustering correlation function.

abstract = {The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) is designed to measure redshifts for approximately 250 000 galaxies. This paper describes the survey design, the spectroscopic observations, the redshift measurements and the survey data base. The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multifibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 2° diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than bJ = 19.45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 8O° × 15° around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 75° × 10° along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000 deg2 and has a median depth of z̄ = 0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93 per cent over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600-8000 {\AA} at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0 {\AA} and a median S/N of 13 pixel-1. All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5; Q ≥ 3 redshifts are 98.4 per cent reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85 km s-1. The overall redshift completeness for Q ≥ 3 redshifts is 91.8 per cent, but this varies with magnitude from 99 per cent for the brightest galaxies to 90 per cent for objects at the survey limit.

abstract = {Nine of the most important estimators known for the two-point correlation function are compared using a predetermined, rigorous criterion. The indicators were extracted from over 500 subsamples of the Virgo Hubble Volume simulation cluster catalog. The ``real'' correlation function was determined from the full survey in a 3000Mpc/h periodic cube. The estimators were ranked by the cumulative probability of returning a value within a certain tolerance of the real correlation function. This criterion takes into account bias and variance, and it is independent of the possibly non-Gaussian nature of the error statistics. As a result for astrophysical applications a clear recommendation has emerged: the Landy {\&} Szalay (1993) estimator, in its original or grid version Szapudi {\&} Szalay (1998), are preferred in comparison to the other indicators examined, with a performance almost indistinguishable from the Hamilton (1993) estimator.},

abstract = {The covariance matrices of Power-Spectrum (P(k)) measurements from galaxy surveys are difficult to compute theoretically. The current best practice is to estimate covariance matrices by computing a sample covariance of a large number of mock catalogues. The next generation of galaxy surveys will require thousands of large volume mocks to determine the covariance matrices to desired accuracy. The errors in the inverse covariance matrix are larger and scale with the number of P(k) bins, making the problem even more acute. We develop a method of estimating covariance matrices using a theoretically justified, Few-Parameter model, calibrated with mock catalogues. Using a set of 600 BOSS DR11 mock catalogues, we show that a seven parameter model is sufficient to fit the covariance matrix of BOSS DR11 P(k) measurements. The covariance computed with this method is better than the sample covariance at any number of mocks and only ∼100 mocks are required for it to fully converge and the inverse covariance matrix converges at the same rate. This method shouldwork equally well for the next generation of galaxy surveys, although a demand for higher accuracy may require adding extra parameters to the fitting function.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the luminosity and color-dependence of galaxy clustering at 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.0 in the Prism Multi-object Survey. We quantify the clustering with the redshift-space and projected two-point correlation functions, $\xi$(rp , $\pi$) and wp (rp ), using volume-limited samples constructed from a parent sample of over ∼130, 000 galaxies with robust redshifts in seven independent fields covering 9 deg 2 of sky. We quantify how the scale-dependent clustering amplitude increases with increasing luminosity and redder color, with relatively small errors over large volumes. We find that red galaxies have stronger small-scale (0.1 Mpc h -1 {\textless} rp {\textless} 1 Mpc h -1) clustering and steeper correlation functions compared to blue galaxies, as well as a strong color dependent clustering within the red sequence alone. We interpret our measured clustering trends in terms of galaxy bias and obtain values of bgal ≈ 0.9-2.5, quantifying how galaxies are biased tracers of dark matter depending on their luminosity and color. We also interpret the color dependence with mock catalogs, and find that the clustering of blue galaxies is nearly constant with color, while redder galaxies have stronger clustering in the one-halo term due to a higher satellite galaxy fraction. In addition, we measure the evolution of the clustering strength and bias, and we do not detect statistically significant departures from passive evolution. We argue that the luminosity- and color-environment (or halo mass) relations of galaxies have not significantly evolved since z ∼ 1. Finally, using jackknife subsampling methods, we find that sampling fluctuations are important and that the COSMOS field is generally an outlier, due to having more overdense structures than other fields; we find that "cosmic variance" can be a significant source of uncertainty for high-redshift clustering measurements. {\textcopyright} 2014.

We find a well-detected peak in the correlation function at 100h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} Mpc separation that is an excellent match to the predicted shape and location of the imprint of the recombination-epoch acoustic oscillations on the low-redshift clustering of matter. This detection demonstrates the linear growth of structure by gravitational instability between z=1000 and the present and confirms a firm prediction of the standard cosmological theory. The acoustic peak provides a standard ruler by which we can measure the ratio of the distances to z=0.35 and z=1089 to 4{\%} fractional accuracy and the absolute distance to z=0.35 to 5{\%} accuracy. From the overall shape of the correlation function, we measure the matter density Omega{\_}mh{\^{}}2 to 8{\%} and find agreement with the value from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Independent of the constraints provided by the CMB acoustic scale, we find Omega{\_}m = 0.273 +- 0.025 + 0.123 (1+w{\_}0) + 0.137 Omega{\_}K. Including the CMB acoustic scale, we find that the spatial curvature is Omega{\_}K=-0.010+-0.009 if the dark energy is a cosmological constant. More generally, our results provide a measurement of cosmological distance, and hence an argument for dark energy, based on a geometric method with the same simple physics as the microwave background anisotropies. The standard cosmological model convincingly passes these new and robust tests of its fundamental properties.},

abstract = {Through analytic techniques verified by numerical calculations, we establish general relations between the matter and cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra and their dependence on cosmological parameters on small scales. Fluctuations in the CMB, baryons, cold dark matter (CDM), and neutrinos receive a boost at horizon crossing. Baryon drag on the photons causes alternating acoustic peak heights in the CMB and is uncovered in its bare form under the photon diffusion scale. Decoupling of the photons at last scattering and of the baryons at the end of the Compton drag epoch, freezes the diffusion-damped acoustic oscillations into the CMB and matter power spectra at different scales. We determine the dependence of the respective acoustic amplitudes and damping lengths on fundamental cosmological parameters. The baryonic oscillations, enhanced by the velocity overshoot effect, compete with CDM fluctuations in the present matter power spectrum. We present new exact analytic solutions for the cold dark matter fluctuations in the presence of a growth- inhibiting radiation {\{}$\backslash$it and{\}} baryon background. Combined with the acoustic contributions and baryonic infall into CDM potential wells, this provides a highly accurate analytic form of the small-scale transfer function in the general case.},

Our observational dataset and the 1400 simulated re-alizations of the dataset allow us to detect a preference for BAO that is greater than 2.8$\sigma$. We determine the spherically averaged BAO distance to z = 1.52 to 3.8 per cent precision: D V (z = 1.52) = 3843 ± 147 (r d /r d,fid) Mpc. This is the first time the location of the BAO feature has been measured between redshifts 1 and 2. Our result is fully consistent with the prediction obtained by extrapolating the Planck flat $\Lambda$CDM best-fit cosmology. All of our results are consistent with basic large-scale structure (LSS) theory, confirming quasars to be a reliable tracer of LSS, and provide a starting point for numerous cosmological tests to be performed with eBOSS quasar samples. We combine our result with previous, independent, BAO distance measurements to construct an updated BAO distance-ladder. Using these BAO data alone and marginalizing over the length of the standard ruler, we find Ω $\Lambda$ {\textgreater} 0 at 6.6$\sigma$ significance when testing a $\Lambda$CDM model with free curvature.},

abstract = {We explore methods for robust estimation of the 21 cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). A Kernel Density Estimator (KDE) is introduced for measuring the spatial temperature fluctuation power spectrum from the EoR. The KDE estimates the underlying probability distribution function of fluctuations as a function of spatial scale, and contains different systematic biases and errors to the typical approach to estimating the fluctuation power spectrum. Extraction of histograms of visibilities allows moments analysis to be used to discriminate foregrounds from 21 cm signal and thermal noise. We use the information available in the histograms, along with the statistical dis-similarity of foregrounds from two independent observing fields, to robustly separate foregrounds from cosmological signal, while making no assumptions about the Gaussianity of the signal. Using two independent observing fields to robustly discriminate signal from foregrounds is crucial for the analysis presented in this paper. We apply the techniques to 13 h of Murchison Widefield Array EoR data over two observing fields. We compare the output to that obtained with a comparative power spectrum estimation method, and demonstrate the reduced foreground contamination using this approach. Using the second moment obtained directly from the KDE distribution functions yields a factor of 2-3 improvement in power for k {\textless} 0.3 h Mpc-1 compared with a matched delay space power estimator, while weighting data by additional statistics does not offer significant improvement beyond that available for thermal noise-only weights.},

abstract = {The Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) is designed to measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys of large-scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as i = 19.9 over 10,000deg2 to measure BAO to redshifts z {\textless} 0.7. Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Ly$\alpha$ forest in more than 150,000quasar spectra (g {\textless} 22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5. Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale three-dimensional clustering of the Ly$\alpha$ forest and a strong detection from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield measurements of the angular diameter distance dA to an accuracy of 1.0{\%} at redshifts z = 0.3 and z = 0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8{\%} and 1.7{\%} at the same redshifts. Forecasts for Ly$\alpha$ forest constraints predict a measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate DA (z) and H -1(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9{\%} at z ∼ 2.5 when the survey is complete.

The ML estimator outperforms the LS estimator in that it results in smaller measurement errors at any fixed random point density. Put another way, the ML estimator can reach the same precision as the LS estimator with a significantly smaller random point catalog. Moreover, these gains are achieved without significantly increasing the computational requirements for estimating {\{}$\backslash$xi{\}}. We quantify the relative improvement of the ML estimator over the LS estimator, and discuss the regimes under which these improvements are most significant. We present a short guide on how to implement the ML estimator, and emphasize that the code alterations required to switch from a LS to a ML estimator are minimal.},

Our main findings are as follows: 1) All of the models can recover unbiased constraints when fit to the pre- and post-reconstruction simulations. 2) Models that provide physical descriptions of the damping of the BAO feature (using e.g., standard perturbation or effective-field theory arguments) report smaller errors on average, although the distribution of mock {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} values indicates these are underestimated. 3) Allowing the BAO damping scale to vary can provide tighter constraints for some mocks, but is an artificial improvement that only arises when noise randomly sharpens the BAO peak. 4) Unlike recent claims in the literature when utilising a BAO Extractor technique, we find no improvement in the accuracy of the recovered BAO scale. 5) We implement a procedure for combining all models into a single consensus result that improves over the standard method without obviously underestimating the uncertainties. Overall, Barry provides an excellent framework for performing the cosmological analyses for upcoming surveys, and for rapidly testing and validating new models.},

abstract = {In theories of modified gravity with the chameleon screening mechanism, the strength of the fifth force depends on environment. This induces an environment dependence of structure formation, which differs from $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM). We show that these differences could be captured by the marked correlation function. With the galaxy correlation functions and number densities calibrated to match between f(R) and $\Lambda$CDM models in simulations, we show that the marked correlation functions by using either the local galaxy number density or halo mass as the marks encode extra information, which can be used to test these theories. We discuss possible applications of these statistics in observations.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the linear growth rate of structure, f from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS III) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Data Release 12 (DR12) using Convolution Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (CLPT) with Gaussian Streaming Redshift-Space Distortions (GSRSD) to model the two point statistics of BOSS galaxies in DR12. The BOSS-DR12 dataset includes 1,198,006 massive galaxies spread over the redshift range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.75. These galaxy samples are categorized in three redshift bins. Using CLPT-GSRSD in our analysis of the combined sample of the three redshift bins, we report measurements of f $\sigma$ 8 for the three redshift bins. We find f $\sigma$ 8 = 0.430 ± 0.054 at z eff = 0.38, f $\sigma$ 8 = 0.452 ± 0.057 at z eff = 0.51 and f $\sigma$ 8 = 0.457 ± 0.052 at z eff = 0.61. Our results are consistent with the predictions of Planck $\Lambda$CDM-GR. Our constraints on the growth rates of structure in the Universe at different redshifts serve as a useful probe, which can help distinguish between a model of the Universe based on dark energy and models based on modified theories of gravity. This paper is part of a set that analyses the final galaxy clustering dataset from BOSS. The measurements and likelihoods presented here are combined with others in Alam et al. (2016) to produce the final cosmological constraints from BOSS.},

abstract = {We present measurements of galaxy clustering from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). These use the Data Release 9 (DR9) CMASS sample, which contains 264 283 massive galaxies covering 3275 square degrees with an effective redshift z = 0.57 and redshift range 0.43 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.7. Assuming a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, this sample covers an effective volume of 2.2 Gpc 3 , and represents the largest sample of the Universe ever surveyed at this density, ¯ n ≈ 3 × 10 −4 h −3 Mpc 3. We measure the angle-averaged galaxy correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of 5$\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Combining with the SDSS-II Luminous Red Galaxy Sample, the detection significance increases to 6.7$\sigma$. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance to z = 0.57 relative to the sound horizon D V /r s = 13.67 ± 0.22 at z = 0.57. Assuming a fiducial sound horizon of 153.19 Mpc, which matches cosmic microwave background constraints, this corresponds to a distance D V (z = 0.57) = 2094 ± 34 Mpc. At 1.7 per cent, this is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. We place this result alongside previous BAO measurements in a cosmological distance ladder and find excellent agreement with the current supernova measurements. We use these distance measurements to constrain various cosmological models, finding continuing support for a flat Universe with a cosmological constant.},

abstract = {The baryon acoustic oscillations are a promising route to the precision measure of the cosmological distance scale and hence the measurement of the time evolution of dark energy. We show that the non-linear degradation of the acoustic signature in the correlations of low-redshift galaxies is a correctable process. By suitable reconstruction of the linear density field, one can sharpen the acoustic peak in the correlation function or, equivalently, restore the higher harmonics of the oscillations in the power spectrum. With this, one can achieve better measurements of the acoustic scale for a given survey volume. Reconstruction is particularly effective at low redshift, where the non-linearities are worse but where the dark energy density is highest. At z=0.3, we find that one can reduce the sample variance error bar on the acoustic scale by at least a factor of 2 and in principle by nearly a factor of 4. We discuss the significant implications our results have for the design of galaxy surveys aimed at measuring the distance scale through the acoustic peak.},

abstract = {We present a one per cent measurement of the cosmic distance scale from the detections of the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of galaxies from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, which is part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. Our results come from the Data Release 11 (DR11) sample, containing nearly one million galaxies and covering approximately 8500 square degrees and the redshift range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.7. We also compare these results with those from the publicly released DR9 and DR10 samples. Assuming a concordance $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmological model, the DR11 sample covers a volume of 13 Gpc3 and is the largest region of the Universe ever surveyed at this density. We measure the correlation function and power spectrum, including density-field reconstruction of the BAO feature. The acoustic features are detected at a significance of over 7$\sigma$ in both the correlation function and power spectrum. Fitting for the position of the acoustic features measures the distance relative to the sound horizon at the drag epoch, rd, which has a value of rd,fid = 149.28 Mpc in our fiducial cosmology. We find DV = (1264 ± 25 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.32 and DV = (2056 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) at z = 0.57. At 1.0 per cent, this latter measure is the most precise distance constraint ever obtained from a galaxy survey. Separating the clustering along and transverse to the line of sight yields measurements at z = 0.57 of DA = (1421 ± 20 Mpc)(rd/rd,fid) and H = (96.8 ± 3.4 kms-1 Mpc-1)(rd,fid/rd). Our measurements of the distance scale are in good agreement with previous BAO measurements and with the predictions from cosmic microwave background data for a spatially flat CDM model with a cosmological constant. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

Existing functionality includes estimators of the power spectrum, 2 and 3-point correlation functions, a Friends-of-Friends grouping algorithm, mock catalog creation via the halo occupation distribution technique, and approximate N-body simulations via the FastPM scheme. The package also provides a set of distributed data containers, insulated from the algorithms themselves, that enable nbodykit to provide a unified treatment of both simulation and observational data sets. nbodykit can be easily deployed in a high performance computing environment, overcoming some of the traditional difficulties of using Python on supercomputers. We provide performance benchmarks illustrating the scalability of the software. The modular, component-based approach of nbodykit allows researchers to easily build complex applications using its tools. The package is extensively documented at http://nbodykit.readthedocs.io, which also includes an interactive set of example recipes for new users to explore.

Our results cover a large range of scales from ∼500 to ∼90 h-1 Mpc. We compare these estimates with the expectations of the flat A cold dark matter (ACDM) standard cosmological model with parameters compatible with Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 data. We use the MultiDark cosmological simulation, one of the largest N-body runs presently available, together with a simple halo abundance matching technique, to estimate galaxy correlation functions, power spectra, abundance of subhaloes and galaxy biases. We find that the ACDM model gives a reasonable description to the observed correlation functions at z ≈ 0.5, which is remarkably good agreement considering that the model, once matched to the observed abundance of BOSS galaxies, does not have any free parameters. However, we find a ≥10 per cent deviation in the correlation functions for scales ≤ 1 and ∼10-40 h-1 Mpc. A more realistic abundance matching model and better statistics from upcoming observations are needed to clarify the situation. We also estimate that about 12 per cent of the 'galaxies' in the abundance-matched sample are satellites inhabiting central haloes with mass M ≥ 1014 h-1 M⊙. Using the MultiDark simulation, we also study the real-space halo bias b of the matched catalogue finding that b = 2.00 ± 0.07 at large scales, consistent with the one obtained using the measured BOSS-projected correlation function. Furthermore, the linear large-scale bias, defined using the extrapolated linear matter power spectrum, depends on the number density n of the abundance-matched sample as b=-0.048- (0.594 ± 0.02)log10(n/ h3 Mpc-3). Extrapolating these results to baryon acoustic oscillation scales, we measure a scale-dependent damping of the acoustic signal produced by non-linear evolution that leads to ∼2-4 per cent dips at ≥ 3s level for wavenumbers k ≥ 0.1 h Mpc-1 in the linear large-scale bias. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {Cosmological parameter estimation requires that the likelihood function of the data is accurately known. Assuming that cosmological large-scale structure power spectra data are multivariate Gaussian distributed, we show that the accuracy of parameter estimation is limited by the accuracy of the inverse data covariance matrix - the precision matrix. If the data covariance and precision matrices are estimated by sampling independent realizations of the data, their statistical properties are described by theWishart and inverse-Wishart distributions, respectively. Independent of any details of the survey, we show that the fractional error on a parameter variance, or a figure of merit, is equal to the fractional variance of the precision matrix. In addition, for the only unbiased estimator of the precision matrix, we find that the fractional accuracy of the parameter error depends only on the difference between the number of independent realizations and the number of data points, and so can easily diverge. For a 5 per cent error on a parameter error and ND « 102 data points, a minimum of 200 realizations of the survey are needed, with 10 per cent accuracy in the data covariance. If the number of data points ND » 102, we need NS {\textgreater} ND realizations and a fractional accuracy of {\textless} √2/ND in the data covariance. As the number of power spectra data points grows to ND {\textgreater} 104-106, this approach will be problematic. We discuss possible ways to relax these conditions: improved theoretical modelling, shrinkage methods, data compression, simulation and data resampling methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a Stage IV ground-based dark energy experiment that will study baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the growth of structure through redshift-space distortions with a wide-area galaxy and quasar redshift survey. To trace the underlying dark matter distribution, spectroscopic targets will be selected in four classes from imaging data. We will measure luminous red galaxies up to z = 1.0. To probe the Universe out to even higher redshift, DESI will target bright [O II] emission line galaxies up to z = 1.7. Quasars will be targeted both as direct tracers of the underlying dark matter distribution and, at higher redshifts (2.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5), for the Ly-$\alpha$ forest absorption features in their spectra, which will be used to trace the distribution of neutral hydrogen. When moonlight prevents efficient observations of the faint targets of the baseline survey, DESI will conduct a magnitude-limited Bright Galaxy Survey comprising approximately 10 million galaxies with a median z ≈ 0.2. In total, more than 30 million galaxy and quasar redshifts will be obtained to measure the BAO feature and determine the matter power spectrum, including redshift space distortions. 2},

abstract = {We present a series of results from a clustering analysis of the first data release of the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) Deep Extragalactic Observations (VIDEO) survey. VIDEO is the only survey currently capable of probing the bulk of stellar mass in galaxies at redshifts corresponding to the peak of star formation on degree scales. Galaxy clustering is measured with the two-point correlation function, which is calculated using a non-parametric kernel-based density estimator. We use our measurements to investigate the connection between the galaxies and the host dark matter halo using a halo occupation distribution methodology, deriving bias, satellite fractions, and typical host halo masses for stellar masses between 109.35 and 1010.85 M⊙, at redshifts 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.7. Our results show typical halo mass increasing with stellar mass (with moderate scatter) and bias increasing with stellar mass and redshift consistent with previous studies. We find that the satellite fraction increased towards low redshifts, from {\~{}}5 per cent at z {\~{}} 1.5 to {\~{}}20 per cent at z {\~{}} 0.6. We combine our results to derive the stellar mass-to-halo mass ratio for both satellites and centrals over a range of halo masses and find the peak corresponding to the halo mass with maximum star formation efficiency to be {\~{}}2 × 1012 M⊙, finding no evidence for evolution.},

abstract = {We present the power spectrum of the reconstructed halo density field derived from a sample of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Seventh Data Release (DR7). The halo power spectrum has a direct connection to the underlying dark matter power for k ≤ 0.2 h Mpc-1, well into the quasi-linear regime. This enables us to use a factor of {\~{}}8 more modes in the cosmological analysis than an analysis with kmax = 0.1 h Mpc-1,aswas adopted in the SDSS team analysis of the DR4 LRG sample. The observed halo power spectrum for 0.02 {\textless}k{\textless}0.2 h Mpc-1 is well fitted by our model: $\chi$2 = 39.6 for 40 degrees of freedom for the best-fitting $\Delta$ cold dark matter ($\Delta$CDM) model. We find $\Omega$mh2(ns/0.96)1.2 = 0.141+0.010-0.012 for a power-law primordial power spectrum with spectral index ns and $\Omega$bh2 = 0.022 65 fixed, consistent with cosmic microwave background measurements. The halo power spectrum also constrains the ratio of the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch to an effective distance to z = 0.35: rs/DV(0.35) = 0.1097+0.0039-0.0042. Combining the halo power spectrum measurement with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5 year results, for the flat $\Delta$CDM model we find $\Omega$m = 0.289 ± 0.019 and H0 = 69.4 ± 1.6 km s-1 Mpc-1. Allowing ∑ for massive neutrinos in $\Delta$CDM, we find $\sigma$m$\nu$ {\textless} 0.62 eV at the 95 per cent confidence level. If we instead consider the effective number of relativistic species Neff as a free parameter, we find Neff = 4.8+1.8-1.7. Combining also with the Kowalski et al. supernova sample, we find $\Omega$tot = 1.011 ± 0.009 and w =-0.99 ± 0.11 for an open cosmology with constant dark energy equation of state w.

abstract = {The baryonic acoustic feature in galaxy clustering is a promising tool for constraining the nature of the cosmic acceleration, through measurements of expansion rates H and angular diameter distances D A. Angle-averaged measurements of clustering yield constraints on the quantity However, to break the degeneracy between these two parameters one must measure the anisotropic clustering as a function of both line-of-sight (radial) and transverse separations. Here we investigate how to most effectively do so, using analytic techniques and mock catalogues. In particular, we examine multipole expansions of the correlation function and introduce 'clustering wedges'$\xi$($\Delta$$\mu$, s), where $\mu$=s ∥/s and s ∥ is the radial component of separation s. Both techniques allow strong constraints on H and D A, as expected. The radial wedges strongly depend on H and the transverse wedges are sensitive to D A. When analysing the full shape of $\xi$, we find similar constraints when using the clustering wedges and the monopole-quadrupole pair. We find additional improvement when using the hexadecapole, as previously mentioned in the literature. Our findings here demonstrate that wedge statistics provide a practical alternative technique to multipoles, which should be useful to test systematics and will provide comparable constraints. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {The Fisher matrix is a widely used tool to forecast the performance of future experiments and approximate the likelihood of large data sets. Most of the forecasts for cosmological parameters in galaxy clustering studies rely on the Fisher matrix approach for large-scale experiments like DES, Euclid, or SKA. Here we improve upon the standard method by taking into account three effects: the finite window function, the correlation between redshift bins, and the uncertainty on the bin redshift. The first two effects are negligible only in the limit of infinite surveys. The third effect, on the contrary, is negligible for infinitely small bins. Here we show how to take into account these effects and what the impact on forecasts of a Euclid-type experiment will be. The main result of this article is that the windowing and the bin cross-correlation induce a considerable change in the forecasted errors, of the order of 10-30{\%} for most cosmological parameters, while the redshift bin uncertainty can be neglected for bins smaller than ∆z = 0.1 roughly.},

abstract = {We apply the methodology developed in $\backslash$cite{\{}Li2014,Li2015{\}} to BOSS DR12 galaxies and derive cosmological constraints from the redshift dependence of the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect. The apparent anisotropy in the distribution of observed galaxies arise from two main sources, the redshift-space distortion (RSD) effect due to the galaxy peculiar velocities, and the geometric distortion when incorrect cosmological models are assumed for transforming redshift to comoving distance, known as the AP effect. Anisotropies produced by the RSD effect are, although large, maintaining a nearly uniform magnitude over a large range of redshift, while the degree of anisotropies from the AP effect varies with redshift by much larger magnitude. We split the DR12 galaxies into six redshift bins, measure the 2-point correlation function in each bin, and assess the redshift evolution of anisotropies. We obtain constraints of {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m=0.290 \backslashpm 0.053,\backslash \backslash w = -1.07 \backslashpm 0.15{\$}, which are comparable with the current constraints from other cosmological probes such as type Ia supernovae, cosmic microwave background, and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO).

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the two-point correlation function, $\xi$ ($\sigma$, $\pi$) from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift purvey (2dFGRS). The large size of the catalogue, which contains ∼220 000 redshifts, allows us to make high-precision measurements of various properties of the galaxy clustering pattern. The effective redshift at which our estimates are made is z s ≈ 0.15, and similarly the effective luminosity, L s ≈ 1.4L*. We estimate the redshift-space correlation function, $\xi$(s), from which we measure the redshift-space clustering length, S 0 = 6. 82 ± 0.28 h -1 Mpc. We also estimate the projected correlation function, $\Xi$ ($\sigma$), and the real-space correlation function, $\xi$(r), which can be fit by a power law (r/r 0) -$\gamma$r, with r 0 = 5.05 ± 0.26 h -1 Mpc, $\gamma$ r = 1.67 ± 0.03. For r ≳ 20 h -1 Mpc, $\xi$ drops below a power law as, for instance, is expected in the popular A cold dark matter model. The ratio of amplitudes of the real- and redshift-space correlation functions on scales of 8-30 h -1 Mpc gives an estimate of the redshift-space distortion parameter $\beta$. The quadrupole moment of $\xi$($\sigma$, $\pi$) on scales 30-40 h -1 Mpc provides another estimate of $\beta$. We also estimate the distribution function of pairwise peculiar velocities, f(v), including rigorously the significant effect due to the infall velocities, and we find that the distribution is well fit by an exponential form. The accuracy of our $\xi$($\sigma$, $\pi$) measurement is sufficient to constrain a model, which simultaneously fits the shape and amplitude of $\xi$(r) and the two redshift-space distortion effects parametrized by $\beta$ and velocity dispersion, a. We find $\beta$= 0.49 ± 0.09 and a = 506 ± 52 km s -1, although the best-fitting values are strongly correlated. We measure the variation of the peculiar velocity dispersion with projected separation, a($\sigma$), and find that the shape is consistent with models and simulations. This is the first time that $\beta$ and f(v) have been estimated from a self-consistent model of galaxy velocities. Using the constraints on bias from recent estimates, and taking account of redshift evolution, we conclude that $\beta$ (L = L*,z = 0) = 0.47 ± 0.08, and that the present-day matter density of the Universe, $\Omega$ m ≈ 0.3, consistent with other 2dFGRS estimates and independent analyses.},

abstract = {Context. The coeval active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxy evolution, and the observed local relations between super massive black holes (SMBHs) and galaxy properties suggest some sort of connection or feedback between SMBH growth (i.e., AGN activity) and galaxy build-up (i.e., star formation history). Aims. We looked for correlations between average properties of X-ray detected AGN and their far-IR (FIR) detected, star forming host galaxies in order to find quantitative evidence for this connection, which has been highly debated in recent years. Methods. We exploited the rich multiwavelength data set (from X-ray to FIR) available in the COSMOS field for a large sample (692 sources) of AGN and their hosts in the redshift range 0.1 {\textless}z{\textless} 4. We use X-ray data to select AGN and determine their properties, such as X-ray intrinsic luminosity and nuclear obscuration, and broadband (from UV to FIR) SED fitting results to derive host galaxy properties, such as stellar mass (M∗) and star formation rate (SFR). Results. We find that the AGN 2-10 keV luminosity (LX) and the host 8-1000 $\mu$m star formation luminosity (LIRSF) are significantly correlated, even after removing the dependency of both quantities with redshift. However, the average host LIRSF has a flat distribution in bins of AGN LX, while the average AGN LX increases in bins of host LIRSF with logarithmic slope of {\~{}}0.7 in the redshift range 0.4 {\textless}z{\textless} 1.2. We also discuss the comparison between the full distribution of these two quantities and the predictions from hydrodynamical simulations. No other significant correlations between AGN LX and host properties is found. On the other hand, we find that the average column density (NH) shows a clear positive correlation with the host M∗ at all redshifts, but not with the SFR (or LIRSF). This translates into a negative correlation with specific SFR at all redshifts. The same is true if the obscured fraction is computed. Conclusions. Our results are in agreement with the idea, introduced in recent galaxy evolutionary models, that SMBH accretion and SFRs are correlated, but occur with different variability time scales. Finally, the presence of a positive correlation between NH and host M∗ suggests that the column density that we observe in the X-rays is not entirely due to the circumnuclear obscuring torus, but may also include a significant contribution from the host galaxy.},

abstract = {We explore how finite integration times or equivalently temporal binning induces morphological distortions to the transit light curve. These distortions, if uncorrected for, lead to the retrieval of erroneous system parameters and may even lead to some planetary candidates being rejected as ostensibly unphysical. We provide analytic expressions for estimating the disturbance to the various light-curve parameters as a function of the integration time. These effects are particularly crucial in light of the long-cadence photometry often used for discovering new exoplanets by, for example, Convection Rotation and Planetary Transits (CoRoT) and the Kepler Missions (8.5 and 30 min). One of the dominant effects of long integration times is a systematic underestimation of the light-curve-derived stellar density, which has significant ramifications for transit surveys. We present a discussion of numerical integration techniques to compensate for the effects and produce expressions to quickly estimate the errors of such methods, as a function of integration time and numerical resolution. This allows for an economic choice of resolution before attempting fits of long-cadence light-curves. We provide a comparison of the short- and long-cadence light curves of TrES-2b and show that the retrieved transit parameters are consistent using the techniques discussed here. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.

abstract = {The use of a lognormal (LN) random field, non-Gaussian random field as a model for the distribution of matter in the universe is discussed. As the general LN field includes the Gaussian case in the limit of zero rms fluctuation it is possible to perform a statistical decomposition. The statistical properties of the model can be formulated in terms of one covariance function. Difficulties with the statistical treatment of density perturbations such as the fact that the LN model is not completely specified by its moments have been revealed by analysis of the model. It is shown that for discriminating between Gaussian and non-Gaussian fluctuations the method of representing the three- and four-point correlation functions of galaxies in terms of the parameters Q and R is not useful. Parameterizations in terms of the skewness and kurtosis are proposed.},

abstract = {We present a power-spectrum analysis of the final 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), employing a direct Fourier method. The sample used comprises 221414 galaxies with measured redshifts. We investigate in detail the modelling of the sample selection, improving on previous treatments in a number of respects. A new angular mask is derived, based on revisions to the photometric calibration. The redshift selection function is determined by dividing the survey according to rest-frame colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatment of k-corrections and evolution for each population. The covariance matrix for the power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches to the construction of mock surveys, which are used to demonstrate that the input cosmological model can be correctly recovered. We discuss in detail the possible differences between the galaxy and mass power spectra, and treat these using simulations, analytic models and a hybrid empirical approach. Based on these investigations, we are confident that the 2dFGRS power spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the universe. On large scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence for the 'baryon oscillations' that are predicted in cold dark matter (CDM) models. Fitting to a CDM model, assuming a primordial n s = 1 spectrum, h = 0.72 and negligible neutrino mass, the preferred parameters are $\Omega$ mh = 0.168 ± 0.016 and a baryon fraction $\Omega$ b/$\Omega$ m = 0.185 ± 0.046 (1$\sigma$ errors). The value of $\Omega$ mh is 1$\sigma$ lower than the 0.20 ± 0.03 in our 2001 analysis of the partially {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS complete 2dFGRS. This shift is largely due to the signal from the newly sampled regions of space, rather than the refinements in the treatment of observational selection. This analysis therefore implies a density significantly below the standard $\Omega$ m = 0.3: in combination with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), we infer $\Omega$ m = 0.231 ± 0.021.},

abstract = {The two-point correlation function (2PCF) is the most widely used tool for quantifying the spatial distribution of galaxies. Since the distribution of galaxies is determined by galaxy formation physics as well as the underlying cosmology, fitting an observed correlation function yields valuable insights into both. The calculation for a 2PCF involves computing pair-wise separations and consequently, the computing time scales quadratically with the number of galaxies. The next-generation galaxy surveys are slated to observe many millions of galaxies, and computing the 2PCF for such surveys would be prohibitively time-consuming. Additionally, modern modelling techniques require the 2PCF to be calculated thousands of times on simulated galaxy catalogues of {\{}$\backslash$em at least{\}} equal size to the data and would be completely unfeasible for the next generation surveys. Thus, calculating the 2PCF forms a substantial bottleneck in improving our understanding of the fundamental physics of the universe, and we need high-performance software to compute the correlation function. In this paper, we present Corrfunc --- a suite of highly optimised, OpenMP parallel clustering codes. The improved performance of Corrfunc arises from both efficient algorithms as well as software design that suits the underlying hardware of modern CPUs. Corrfunc can compute a wide range of 2-D and 3-D correlation functions in either simulation (Cartesian) space or on-sky coordinates. Corrfunc runs efficiently in both single- and multi-threaded modes and can compute a typical 2-point projected correlation function ({\$}w{\_}p(r{\_}p){\$}) for {\~{}}1 million galaxies within a few seconds on a single thread. Corrfunc is designed to be both user-friendly and fast and is publicly available at https://github.com/manodeep/Corrfunc.},

We analyse this data set in Fourier space, using the power-spectrum multipoles to measure redshift-space distortions simultaneously with the Alcock-Paczynski effect and the baryon acoustic oscillation scale. We include the power-spectrum monopole, quadrupole and hexadecapole in our analysis and compare our measurements with a perturbation-theory-based model, while properly accounting for the survey window function. To evaluate the reliability of our analysis pipeline, we participate in a mock challenge, which results in systematic uncertainties significantly smaller than the statistical uncertainties.

What new information does it contain beyond conventional statistics? Through the development of a perturbative model, we find that the mark induces a significant coupling between small-scale non-Gaussianities and large scales, leading to the additional information content. The model is derived in the context of one-loop perturbation theory and validated by comparison to {\$}N{\$}-body simulations across a variety of mark parameters. At moderate redshifts, including for massive neutrino cosmologies, the theory is in good agreement with the simulations. The mixing of large and small scales complicates the modeling as there is no well-defined convergence radius of the theory at low {\$}z{\$}. Extension to higher perturbative order and biased tracers is possible via a similar approach, and a simple model of the latter is shown to yield promising results. The theory becomes non-perturbative at redshift zero for small smoothing scales. This suggests that marked spectrum may have important contributions from baryonic effects even at low {\$}k{\$}: these will need to be studied before the full power of this tool can be realized.},

This is expected to result in a scale-dependent dipolar modulation of the acceleration of the expansion rate inferred from observations of objects within the bulk flow. From a maximum-likelihood analysis of the Joint Light-curve Analysis catalogue of Type Ia supernovae, we find that the deceleration parameter, in addition to a small monopole, indeed has a much bigger dipole component aligned with the cosmic microwave background dipole, which falls exponentially with redshift z: q0 = qm + qd.n' exp(-z/S). The best fit to data yields qd = -8.03 and S = 0.0262 (? d ∼ 100 Mpc), rejecting isotropy (qd = 0) with 3.9$\sigma$ statistical significance, while qm = -0.157 and consistent with no acceleration (qm = 0) at 1.4$\sigma$. Thus the cosmic acceleration deduced from supernovae may be an artefact of our being non-Copernican observers, rather than evidence for a dominant component of "dark energy" in the Universe.},

The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10{\%} to 15{\%} farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega{\_}M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q{\_}0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega{\_}M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q{\_}0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively.

For a flat-Universe prior (Omega{\_}M+Omega{\_}Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega{\_}M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination.

abstract = {A generic prediction of hierarchical clustering models is that the mass function of dark haloes in dense regions in the Universe should be top-heavy. We provide a novel test of this prediction using a sample of galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To perform the test, we compare measurements of galaxy clustering in dense and underdense regions. We find that galaxies in dense regions cluster significantly more strongly than those in less dense regions. This is true over the entire 0.1-30 Mpc pair separation range for which we can make accurate measurements. We make similar measurements in realistic mock catalogues in which the only environmental effects are those which arise from the predicted correlation between halo mass and environment. We also provide an analytic halo model based calculation of the effect. Both the mock catalogues and the analytic calculation provide rather good descriptions of the SDSS measurements. Thus, our results provide strong support for hierarchical models. They suggest that, unless care is taken to study galaxies at fixed mass, correlations between galaxy properties and the surrounding environment are almost entirely due to more fundamental correlations between galaxy properties and host halo mass, and between halo mass and environment. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {Understanding the clustering of galaxies has long been a goal of modern observational cosmology. Utilizing our photometric redshift technique a volume limited sample containing more than 2 million galaxies is constructed from the SDSS galaxy catalog. In the largest such analysis to date, we study the angular clustering as a function of luminosity and spectral type. Using Limber's equation we calculate the clustering length for the full data set as r0=5.77+/-0.10 Mpc/h. We find that r0 increases with luminosity by a factor of 1.6 over the sampled luminosity range, in agreement with previous redshift surveys. We also find that both the clustering length and the slope of the correlation function depend on the galaxy type. In particular, by splitting the galaxies in four groups by their rest-frame type we find a bimodal behavior in their clustering properties. Galaxies with spectral types similar to elliptical galaxies have a correlation length of 6.59 +/- 0.17 Mpc/h and a slope of the angular correlation function of 0.96 +/- 0.05 while blue galaxies have a clustering length of 4.51 +/- 0.19 Mpc/h and a slope of 0.68 +/- 0.09. The two intermediate color groups behave like their more extreme 'siblings', rather than showing a gradual transition in slope. We discuss these correlations in the context of current cosmological models for structure formation.},

abstract = {Recent cosmological analyses (e.g., JLA, Pantheon) of Type Ia Supernova (SNIa) have propagated systematic uncertainties into a covariance matrix and either binned or smoothed the systematic vectors in redshift space. We demonstrate that systematic error budgets of these analyses can be improved by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim1.5\backslashtimes{\$} with the use of unbinned and unsmoothed covariance matrices. To understand this, we employ a separate approach that simultaneously fits for cosmological parameters and additional self-calibrating scale parameters that constrain the size of each systematic. We show that the covariance-matrix approach and scale-parameter approach yield equivalent results, implying that in both cases the data can self-calibrate certain systematic uncertainties, but that this ability is hindered when information is binned or smoothed in redshift space. We review the top systematic uncertainties in current analyses and find that the reduction of systematic uncertainties in the unbinned case depends on whether a systematic is consistent with varying the cosmological model and whether or not the systematic can be described by additional correlations between SN properties and luminosity. Furthermore, we show that the power of self-calibration increases with the size of the dataset, which presents a tremendous opportunity for upcoming analyses of photometrically classified samples, like those of Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope (NGRST). However, to take advantage of self-calibration in large, photometrically-classified samples, we must first address the issue that binning is required in currently-used photometric methodologies.},

We measured the two-point real-space correlation function wp(rp) for four volume-limited subsamples selected by stellar mass and four volume-limited subsamples selected by MUV absolute magnitude. We find that the scale-dependent clustering amplitude r0 significantly increases with increasing luminosity and stellar mass. For the least luminous galaxies (MUV {\textless} -19.0), we measured a correlation length r0 = 2.87 ± 0.22 h-1 Mpc and slope $\gamma$ = 1.59 ± 0.07, while for the most luminous (MUV {\textless} -20.2) r0 = 5.35 ± 0.50 h-1 Mpc and $\gamma$ = 1.92 ± 0.25. These measurements correspond to a strong relative bias between these two subsamples of $\Delta$b/b∗ = 0.43. Fitting a five-parameter halo occupation distribution (HOD) model, we find that the most luminous (MUV {\textless} -20.2) and massive (M∗ {\textgreater} 1010 h-1 M⊙) galaxies occupy the most massive dark matter haloes with 〈Mh〉 = 1012.30 h-1 M⊙. Similar to the trends observed at lower redshift, the minimum halo mass Mmin depends on the luminosity and stellar mass of galaxies and grows from Mmin = 109.73 h-1 M⊙ to Mmin = 1011.58 h-1 M⊙ from the faintest to the brightest among our galaxy sample, respectively. We find the difference between these halo masses to be much more pronounced than is observed for local galaxies of similar properties. Moreover, at z {\~{}} 3, we observe that the masses at which a halo hosts, on average, one satellite and one central galaxy is M1 ≈ 4Mmin over all luminosity ranges, which is significantly lower than observed at z {\~{}} 0; this indicates that the halo satellite occupation increases with redshift. The luminosity and stellar mass dependence is also reflected in the measurements of the large-scale galaxy bias, which we model as bg,HOD ({\textgreater}L) = 1.92 + 25.36(L/L∗)7.01. We conclude our study with measurements of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (SHMR). We observe a significant model-observation discrepancy for low-mass galaxies, suggesting a higher than expected star formation efficiency of these galaxies.},

They are based upon a physically well-motivated separation of the effects of acoustic oscillations, Compton drag, velocity overshoot, baryon infall, adiabatic damping, Silk damping, and cold-dark-matter growth suppression. We also find a simpler, more accurate, and better motivated form for the zero baryon transfer function than previous works. These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction Ω b /Ω 0 ∼ {\textgreater} Ω 0 h 2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon. We provide a simple but accurate description of this effect and stress that it is not well approximated by a change in the shape parameter $\Gamma$.

abstract = {Intrinsically bright galaxies appear systematically more correlated than faint galaxies in the Center for Astrophysics redshift survey. The amplification of the 2-point correlation function behaves exponentially with luminosity, being essentially flat up to the knee of the luminosity function, then increasing markedly. The amplification reaches a factor of 3.5e ±0 * 4 in the very brightest galaxies. The effect is dominated by spirals rather than ellipticals, so that the correlation function of bright spirals becomes comparable to that of normal ellipticals. Similar results are obtained whether the correlation function is measured in two or three dimensions. The effect persists to separations of a correlation length or more, and is not confined to the cores of the Virgo, Coma, and Abell 1367 clusters, suggesting that the effect is caused by biasing, that is, galaxies kindle preferentially in more clustered regions, rather than by gravitational relaxation.},

Focusing on a quasi-volume-limited (0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.36) subsample and utilizing mock galaxy catalogs, we demonstrate that the observed baryonic acoustic peak and larger scale signal are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM at 70{\%}-95{\%} confidence.

This redshift-space distance s p is related to the comoving sound horizon scale rs after taking into account matter-clustering non-linearities, redshift distortions, and galaxy-clustering bias. Mock catalogs show that the probability that a DR7-sized sample would not have an identifiable peak is at least {\~{}}10{\%}.

Comparison with other determinations in the literature are also in very good agreement. The signal of the full sample at 125 h -1 Mpc {\textless} s {\textless} 200 h -1 Mpc tends to be high relative to theoretical expectations; this slight deviation can probably be attributed to sample variance.

abstract = {We present measurements of the redshift-space luminosity-weighted or 'marked' correlation function in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These are compared with a model in which the luminosity function and luminosity dependence of clustering are the same as that observed, and in which the form of the luminosity-weighted correlation function is entirely a consequence of the fact that massive haloes populate dense regions. We do this by using mock catalogues which are constrained to reproduce the observed luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of clustering, as well as by using the language of the redshift-space halo model. These analyses show that marked correlations may show a signal on large scales even if there are no large-scale physical effects - the statistical correlation between haloes and their environment will produce a measurable signal. Our model is in good agreement with the measurements, indicating that the halo mass function in dense regions is top heavy; the correlation between halo mass and large-scale environment is the primary driver for correlations between galaxy properties and environment; and the luminosity of the central galaxy in a halo is different from (in general, brighter than) that of the other objects in the halo. Thus our measurement provides strong evidence for the accuracy of these three standard assumptions of galaxy formation models. These assumptions also form the basis of current halo-model-based interpretations of galaxy clustering. When the same galaxies are weighted by their u-, g- or r-band luminosities, then the marked correlation function is stronger in the redder bands. When the weight is galaxy colour rather than luminosity, then the data suggest that close pairs of galaxies tend to have redder colours. This wavelength dependence of marked correlations is in qualitative agreement with galaxy formation models, and reflects the fact that the mean luminosity of galaxies in a halo depends more strongly on halo mass in the r-band than in u. The luminosity and colour dependence we find are consistent with models in which the galaxy population in clusters is more massive than the population in the field. If the u-band luminosity is a reliable tracer of star formation, then our results suggest that cluster galaxies have lower star formation rates. The virtue of this measurement of environmental trends is that it does not require classification of galaxies into field, group and cluster environments. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {We present a public code to generate a mock galaxy catalog in redshift space assuming a log-normal probability density function (PDF) of galaxy and matter density fields. We draw galaxies by Poisson-sampling the log-normal field, and calculate the velocity field from the linearised continuity equation of matter fields, assuming zero vorticity. This procedure yields a PDF of the pairwise velocity fields that is qualitatively similar to that of N-body simulations. We check fidelity of the catalog, showing that the measured two-point correlation function and power spectrum in real space agree with the input precisely. We find that a linear bias relation in the power spectrum does not guarantee a linear bias relation in the density contrasts, leading to a cross-correlation coefficient of matter and galaxies deviating from unity on small scales. We also find that linearising the Jacobian of the real-to-redshift space mapping provides a poor model for the two-point statistics in redshift space. That is, non-linear redshift-space distortion is dominated by non-linearity in the Jacobian. The power spectrum in redshift space shows a damping on small scales that is qualitatively similar to that of the well-known Fingers-of-God (FoG) effect due to random velocities, except that the log-normal mock does not include random velocities. This damping is a consequence of non-linearity in the Jacobian, and thus attributing the damping of the power spectrum solely to FoG, as commonly done in the literature, is misleading.},

We have generated (6000) 12 288 MultiDark PATCHY BOSS (DR11) DR12 light cones corresponding to an effective volume of {\~{}} 192 000 [h-1 Gpc]3 (the largest ever simulated volume), including cosmic evolution in the redshift range from 0.15 to 0.75. The mocks have been calibrated using a reference galaxy catalogue based on the halo abundance matching modelling of the BOSS DR11 and DR12 galaxy clustering data and on the data themselves. The production follows three steps. First, we apply the PATCHY code to generate a dark matter field and an object distribution including non-linear stochastic galaxy bias. Secondly, we run the halo/stellar distribution reconstruction HADRON code to assign masses to the various objects. This step uses the mass distribution as a function of local density and non-local indicators (i.e. tidal field tensor eigenvalues and relative halo exclusion separation for massive objects) from the reference simulation applied to the corresponding patchy dark matter and galaxy distribution. Finally, we apply the SUGAR code to build the light cones. The resulting MultiDarkPATCHY mock light cones reproduce the number density, selection function, survey geometry, and in general within 1s, for arbitrary stellar mass bins, the power spectrum up to k = 0.3 h Mpc-1, the two-point correlation functions down to a few Mpc scales, and the three-point statistics of the BOSS DR11 and DR12 galaxy samples.},

abstract = {We perform the first fit to the anisotropic clustering of SDSS-III CMASS DR10 galaxies on scales of ∼ 0.8−32 h −1 Mpc. A standard halo occupation distribution model evaluated near the best fit Planck $\Lambda$CDM cosmology provides a good fit to the observed anisotropic clustering, and implies a normalization for the peculiar velocity field of M ∼ 2 × 10 13 h −1 M halos of f $\sigma$ 8 (z = 0.57) = 0.450 ± 0.011. Since this constraint includes both quasi-linear and non-linear scales, it should severely constrain modified gravity models that enhance pairwise infall velocities on these scales. Though model dependent, our measurement represents a factor of 2.5 improvement in precision over the analysis of DR11 on large scales, f $\sigma$ 8 (z = 0.57) = 0.447 ± 0.028, and is the tightest single constraint on the growth rate of cosmic structure to date. Our measurement is consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM prediction of 0.480 ± 0.010 at the ∼ 1.9$\sigma$ level. Assuming a halo mass function evaluated at the best fit Planck cosmology, we also find that 10{\%} of CMASS galaxies are satellites in halos of mass M ∼ 6 × 10 13 h −1 M. While none of our tests and model generalizations indicate systematic errors due to an insufficiently detailed model of the galaxy-halo connection, the precision of these first results warrant further investigation into the modeling uncertainties and degeneracies with cosmological parameters.},

Our measurements of wp(rp) as a function of the r-band luminosity are in excellent agreement with the previous two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and SDSS analyses. We compute wp(rp) as a function of stellar mass and we find that more-massive galaxies cluster more strongly than less-massive galaxies, with the difference increasing above the characteristic stellar mass M* of the Schechter mass function. We then divide our sample according to colour, 4000-{\AA} break strength, concentration and surface density. As expected, galaxies with redder colours, larger 4000-{\AA} break strengths, higher concentrations and larger surface mass densities cluster more strongly. The clustering differences are largest on small scales and for low-mass galaxies. At fixed stellar mass, the dependences of clustering on colour and 4000-{\AA} break strength are similar. Different results are obtained when galaxies are split by concentration or surface density. The dependence of wp(rp) on g - r and D4000 extends out to physical scales that are significantly larger than those of individual dark matter haloes ({\textgreater}5 h-1 Mpc). This large-scale clustering dependence is not seen for the parameters C or $\mu$* On small scales ({\textless} 1 h -l Mpc), the amplitude of the correlation function is constant for 'young' galaxies with 1.1 {\textless} D4000 1.5 and a steeply rising function of age for 'older' galaxies with D4000 1.5. In contrast, the dependence of the amplitude of wp(rp) on concentration on scales less than 1 h-1Mpc is strongest for disc-dominated galaxies with C {\textless} 2.6. This demonstrates that different proceses are required to explain environmental trends in the structure and in the star formation history of galaxies. {\textcopyright} 006 RAS.},

abstract = {Studies investigating the relationship between star formation rate (SFR) and AGN power often rely on averaging techniques -- such as stacking -- to incorporate information from non-detections. However, averages, and especially means, can be strongly affected by outliers and can therefore give a misleading indication of the "typical" case. Recently, a number of studies have taken a step further by binning their sample in terms of AGN power, and investigating how the SFR distribution differs between these bins. These bin thresholds are often weakly motivated, and binning implicitly assumes that sources within the same bin have similar (or even identical) properties. In this paper, we investigate whether the main sequence-normalised SFR (i.e., starburstiness, {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm MS{\}}{\$}) distribution changes continuously as a function of AGN power, using a hierarchical Bayesian model that completely removes the need to bin. In doing so, we find strong evidence that the {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm MS{\}}{\$} distribution changes with AGN power, such that higher X-ray luminosity AGNs have a tighter physical connection to the star forming process than lower luminosity AGNs.},

abstract = {Marked statistics allow sensitive tests of how galaxy properties correlate with environment, as well as of how correlations between galaxy properties are affected by environment. A halo-model description of marked correlations is developed, which incorporates the effects which arise from the facts that typical galaxy marks (e.g. luminosity, colour, star formation rate, stellar mass) depend on the mass of the parent halo, and that massive haloes extend to larger radii and populate denser regions. Comparison with measured marked statistics in semi-analytic galaxy formation models shows good agreement on scales smaller than a megaparsec, and excellent agreement on larger scales. The halo-model description shows clearly that the behaviour of some low-order marked statistics on these scales encodes information about the mean galaxy mark as a function of halo mass, but is insensitive to mark gradients within haloes. Higher-order statistics encode information about higher-order moments of the distribution of marks within haloes. This information is obtained without ever having to identify haloes or clusters in the galaxy distribution. On scales smaller than a megaparsec, the halo-model calculation shows that marked statistics allow sensitive tests of whether or not central galaxies in haloes are a special population. A prescription for including more general mark gradients in the halo-model description is also provided. The formalism developed here is particularly well suited to interpretation of marked statistics in astrophysical data sets, because it is phrased in the same language that is currently used to interpret more standard measures of galaxy clustering. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

A combined analysis gives dark matter density {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}c h{\^{}}2 = 0.120\backslashpm 0.001{\$}, baryon density {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}b h{\^{}}2 = 0.0224\backslashpm 0.0001{\$}, scalar spectral index {\$}n{\_}s = 0.965\backslashpm 0.004{\$}, and optical depth {\$}\backslashtau = 0.054\backslashpm 0.007{\$} (in this abstract we quote {\$}68\backslash,\backslash{\%}{\$} confidence regions on measured parameters and {\$}95\backslash,\backslash{\%}{\$} on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to {\$}0.03\backslash,\backslash{\%}{\$} precision, with {\$}100\backslashtheta{\_}*=1.0411\backslashpm 0.0003{\$}. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-{\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant {\$}H{\_}0 = (67.4\backslashpm 0.5){\$}km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m = 0.315\backslashpm 0.007{\$}; and matter fluctuation amplitude {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}8 = 0.811\backslashpm 0.006{\$}. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-{\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model.

The mass could be in dark halos extending to this scale. Alternatively the mass could be clustered like the galaxies if matter loosely associated with the fainter galaxies deleted in our analysis carries the bulk of the mass density, so that M/L is a decreasing function of luminosity. We argue that the available evidence tends to favor the latter picture. We derive the cosmological density parameter Q = 0.2 e ± 04 for the component},

abstract = {Second-order measures, such as the two-point correlation function, are geometrical quantities describing the clustering properties of a point distribution. In this article well-known estimators for the correlation integral are reviewed and their relation to geometrical estimators for the two-point correlation function is put forward. Simulations illustrate the range of applicability of these estimators. The interpretation of the two-point correlation function as the excess of clustering with respect to Poisson distributed points has led to biases in common estimators. Comparing with the approximately unbiased geometrical estimators, we show how biases enter the estimators introduced by Davis and Peebles, Landy and Szalay, and Hamilton. We give recommendations for the application of the estimators, including details of the numerical implementation. The properties of the estimators of the correlation integral are illustrated in an application to a sample of IRAS galaxies. It is found that, due to the limitations of current galaxy catalogues in number and depth, no reliable determination of the correlation integral on large scales is possible. In the sample of IRAS galaxies considered, several estimators using different finite-size corrections yield different results on scales larger than 20 Mpc/h, while all of them agree on smaller scales.},

abstract = {We investigate the bias and error in estimates of the cosmological parameter covariance matrix due to sampling or modelling the data covariance matrix, for likelihood width and peak scatter estimators.We show that these estimators do not coincide unless the data covariance is exactly known. For sampled data covariances with Gaussian-distributed data and parameters, the parameter covariance matrix estimated from the width of the likelihood has aWishart distribution, from which we derive the mean and covariance. This mean is biased and we propose an unbiased estimator of the parameter covariance matrix. Comparing our analytic results to a numerical Wishart sampler of the data covariance matrix we find excellent agreement. An accurate ansatz for the mean parameter covariance for the peak scatter estimator is found, and we fit its covariance to our numerical analysis. The mean is again biased and we propose an unbiased estimator for the peak parameter covariance. For sampled data covariances, the width estimator is more accurate than the peak scatter estimator. We investigate modelling the data covariance, or equivalently data compression, and show that the peak scatter estimator is less sensitive to biases in the model data covariance matrix than the width estimator, but requires independent realizations of the data to reduce the statistical error. If the model bias on the peak estimator is sufficiently low, this is promising, otherwise the sampled width estimator is preferable {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {We present improved methodology for including covariance matrices in the error budget of Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) galaxy clustering measurements, revisiting Data Release 9 (DR9) analyses, and describing a method that is used in DR10/11 analyses presented in companion papers. The precise analysis method adopted is becoming increasingly important, due to the precision that BOSS can now reach: even using as many as 600 mock catalogues to estimate covariance of two-point clustering measurements can still lead to an increase in the errors of ̃20 per cent, depending on how the cosmological parameters of interest are measured. In this paper, we extend previous work on this contribution to the error budget, deriving formulae for errors measured by integrating over the likelihood, and to the distribution of recovered best-fitting parameters fitting the simulations also used to estimate the covariance matrix. Both are situations that previous analyses of BOSS have considered. We apply the formulae derived to baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements from BOSS in our companion papers. To further aid these analyses, we consider the optimum number of bins to use for two-point measurements using the monopole power spectrum or correlation function for BAO, and the monopole and quadrupole moments of the correlation function for anisotropic-BAO and RSD measurements. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

@article{Padmanabhan2006,
abstract = {We present a new estimator, omega, of the small scale galaxy correlation function that is robust against the effects of redshift space distortions and large scale structures. The estimator is a weighted integral of the redshift space or angular correlation function and is a convolution of the real space correlation function with a localized filter. This allows a direct comparison with theory, without modeling redshift space distortions and the large scale correlation function. This has a number of advantages over the more traditional w{\_}p estimator, including (i) an insensitivity to large scale structures and the details of the truncation of the line of sight integral, (ii) a compact kernel in xi(r), and (iii) being unbinned. We discuss how this estimator would be used in practice, applying it to a sample of mock galaxies selected from the Millennium simulation.},

@article{Yuan2020,
abstract = {We propose a flexible method for estimating luminosity functions (LFs) based on kernel density estimation (KDE), the most popular nonparametric density estimation approach developed in modern statistics, to overcome issues surrounding binning of LFs. One challenge in applying KDE to LFs is how to treat the boundary bias problem, since astronomical surveys usually obtain truncated samples predominantly due to the flux-density limits of surveys. We use two solutions, the transformation KDE method ({\$}\backslashhat{\{}\backslashphi{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}t{\}}{\}}{\$}), and the transformation-reflection KDE method ({\$}\backslashhat{\{}\backslashphi{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}tr{\}}{\}}{\$}) to reduce the boundary bias. We develop a new likelihood cross-validation criterion for selecting optimal bandwidths, based on which, the posterior probability distribution of bandwidth and transformation parameters for {\$}\backslashhat{\{}\backslashphi{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}t{\}}{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashhat{\{}\backslashphi{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}tr{\}}{\}}{\$} are derived within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling procedure. The simulation result shows that {\$}\backslashhat{\{}\backslashphi{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}t{\}}{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashhat{\{}\backslashphi{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}tr{\}}{\}}{\$} perform better than the traditional binned method, especially in the sparse data regime around the flux-limit of a survey or at the bright-end of the LF. To further improve the performance of our KDE methods, we develop the transformation-reflection adaptive KDE approach ({\$}\backslashhat{\{}\backslashphi{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}tra{\}}{\}}{\$}). Monte Carlo simulations suggest that it has a good stability and reliability in performance, and is around an order of magnitude more accurate than using the binned method. By applying our adaptive KDE method to a quasar sample, we find that it achieves estimates comparable to the rigorous determination by a previous work, while making far fewer assumptions about the LF. The KDE method we develop has the advantages of both parametric and non-parametric methods.},

@article{VargasMagana2013,
abstract = {Measuring the two-point correlation function of the galaxies in the Universe gives access to the underlying dark matter distribution, which is related to cosmological parameters and to the physics of the primordial Universe. The estimation of the correlation function for current galaxy surveys makes use of the Landy-Szalay estimator, which is supposed to reach minimal variance. This is only true, however, for a vanishing correlation function. We study the Landy-Szalay estimator when these conditions are not fulfilled and propose a new estimator that provides the smallest variance for a given survey geometry. Our estimator is a linear combination of ratios between paircounts of data and/or random catalogues (DD, RR and DR). The optimal combination for a given geometry is determined by using lognormal mock catalogues. The resulting estimator is biased in a model-dependent way, but we propose a simple iterative procedure for obtaining an unbiased model-independent estimator. Our method can be easily applied to any dataset and requires few extra mock catalogues compared to the standard Landy-Szalay analysis. Using various sets of simulated data (lognormal, second-order LPT and N-Body), we obtain a 20-25{\%} gain on the error bars on the two-point correlation function for the SDSS geometry and $\Lambda$CDM correlation function. When applied to SDSS data (DR7 and DR9), we achieve a similar gain on the correlation functions, which translates into a 10-15{\%} improvement over the estimation of the densities of matter Ωm and dark energy Ω$\Lambda$ in an open $\Lambda$CDM model. The constraints derived from DR7 data with our estimator are similar to those obtained with the DR9 data and the Landy-Szalay estimator, which covers a volume twice as large and has a density that is three times higher.},
